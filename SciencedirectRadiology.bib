abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis is a unique disease diagnosis method with thousands of years of TCM theory and effective experience. Its thinking mode in the process is different from that of modern medicine, which includes the essence of TCM theory. From the perspective of clinical application, the four diagnostic methods of TCM, including inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation, have been widely accepted by TCM practitioners worldwide. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decades, AI based TCM diagnosis has also grown rapidly, marked by the emerging of a large number of data-driven deep learning models. In this paper, our aim is to simply but systematically review the development of the data-driven technologies applied to the four diagnostic approaches, i.e. the four examinations, in TCM, including data sets, digital signal acquisition devices, and learning based computational algorithms, to better analyze the development of AI-based TCM diagnosis, and provide references for new research and its applications in TCM settings in the future.}

We examined key areas requiring standardization, including acquisition protocols, contrast agent dosing, and interpretation of background parenchymal enhancement. Safety concerns regarding radiation exposure and contrast media reactions were addressed, along with a comparison between CEM and breast MRI in terms of diagnostic performance. New applications such as CEM-guided biopsies and supplemental screening in high-risk women were critically reviewed and the integration of artificial intelligence and radiomics into CEM interpretation was also considered and discussed. Finally, we briefly summarized the main ongoing multicenter trials investigating the clinical utility and implementation of CEM across different healthcare settings.}

abstract = {Importance
For the assessment of optimum treatment timing in dentofacial orthopedics, understanding the growth process is of paramount importance. The evaluation of skeletal maturity based on study of the morphology of the cervical vertebrae has been devised to minimize radiation exposure of a patient due to hand wrist radiography. Cervical vertebral maturation assessment (CVMA) predictions have been examined in the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in the recent past which require more attention and validation by clinicians and practitioners.
Objectives
This paper aimed to answer the question “How are machine learning techniques being employed in studies concerning cervical vertebral maturation assessment using lateral cephalograms?”
Method
A systematic search through the available literature was performed for this work based upon the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (PICO) framework.
Data sources, study selection, data extraction and synthesis
The searches were performed in Ovid Medline, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). A search of the grey literature was also performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. We also did a hand-searching in the Angle Orthodontist, Journal of Orthodontics and Craniofacial Research, Progress in Orthodontics, and the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics. References from the included articles were also searched.
Main outcome(s) and measure(s), results
A total of 25 papers which were assessed for full text, and 13 papers were included for the systematic review. The machine learning methods used were scrutinized according to their performance and comparison to human observers/experts. The accuracy of the models ranged between 60 and 90% or above, and satisfactory agreement and correlation with the human observers.
Conclusions and relevance
Machine learning models can be used for detection and classification of the cervical vertebrae maturation. In this systematic review (SR), the studies were summarized in terms of ML techniques applied, sample data, age range of sample and conventional method for CVMA, which showed that further studies with a uniform distribution of samples equally in stages of maturation and according to the gender is required for better training of the models in order to generalize the outputs for prolific use to target population.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is often heralded as a potential disruptor that will transform the practice of medicine. The amount of data collected and available in health care, coupled with advances in computational power, has contributed to advances in AI and an exponential growth of publications. However, the development of AI applications does not guarantee their adoption into routine practice. There is a risk that despite the resources invested, benefits for patients, staff, and society will not be realized if AI implementation is not better understood.
Objective
The aim of this study was to explore how the implementation of AI in health care practice has been described and researched in the literature by answering 3 questions: What are the characteristics of research on implementation of AI in practice? What types and applications of AI systems are described? What characteristics of the implementation process for AI systems are discernible?
Methods
A scoping review was conducted of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases to identify empirical studies of AI implementation in health care since 2011, in addition to snowball sampling of selected reference lists. Using Rayyan software, we screened titles and abstracts and selected full-text articles. Data from the included articles were charted and summarized.
Results
Of the 9218 records retrieved, 45 (0.49%) articles were included. The articles cover diverse clinical settings and disciplines; most (32/45, 71%) were published recently, were from high-income countries (33/45, 73%), and were intended for care providers (25/45, 56%). AI systems are predominantly intended for clinical care, particularly clinical care pertaining to patient-provider encounters. More than half (24/45, 53%) possess no action autonomy but rather support human decision-making. The focus of most research was on establishing the effectiveness of interventions (16/45, 35%) or related to technical and computational aspects of AI systems (11/45, 24%). Focus on the specifics of implementation processes does not yet seem to be a priority in research, and the use of frameworks to guide implementation is rare.
Conclusions
Our current empirical knowledge derives from implementations of AI systems with low action autonomy and approaches common to implementations of other types of information systems. To develop a specific and empirically based implementation framework, further research is needed on the more disruptive types of AI systems being implemented in routine care and on aspects unique to AI implementation in health care, such as building trust, addressing transparency issues, developing explainable and interpretable solutions, and addressing ethical concerns around privacy and data protection.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to personalize treatment strategies for patients with cancer. However, current methodological weaknesses could limit clinical impact. We identified common limitations and suggested potential solutions to facilitate translation of AI to breast cancer management.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and PubMed Central in July 2021. Studies investigating the performance of AI to predict outcomes among patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer were included. Algorithm design and adherence to reporting standards were assessed following the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and correspondence with authors to assess data and code availability.
Results
Our search identified 1,124 studies, of which 64 were included: 58 had a retrospective study design, with 6 studies with a prospective design. Access to datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 77% and 88% of studies, respectively). On request, data and code were made available in 28% and 18% of cases, respectively. Ethnicity was often under-reported (not reported in 52 of 64, 81%), as was model calibration (63/64, 99%). The risk of bias was high in 72% (46/64) of the studies, especially because of analysis bias.
Conclusion
Development of AI algorithms should involve external and prospective validation, with improved code and data availability to enhance reliability and translation of this promising approach. Protocol registration number: PROSPERO - CRD42022292495.}

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly applied for medical image diagnostics. We performed a scoping review, exploring (1) use cases, (2) methodologies and (3) findings of studies applying CNN on dental image material.
Sources
Medline via PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv were searched.
Study selection
Full-text articles and conference-proceedings reporting CNN application on dental imagery were included.
Data
Thirty-six studies, published 2015-2019, were included, mainly from four countries (South Korea, United States, Japan, China). Studies focussed on general dentistry (n = 15 studies), cariology (n = 5), endodontics (n = 2), periodontology (n = 3), orthodontics (n = 3), dental radiology (2), forensic dentistry (n = 2) and general medicine (n = 4). Most often, the detection, segmentation or classification of anatomical structures, including teeth (n = 9), jaw bone (n = 2) and skeletal landmarks (n = 4) was performed. Detection of pathologies focused on caries (n = 3). The most commonly used image type were panoramic radiographs (n = 11), followed by periapical radiographs (n = 8), Cone-Beam CT or conventional CT (n = 6). Dataset sizes varied between 10–5,166 images (mean 1,053). Most studies used medical professionals to label the images and constitute the reference test. A large range of outcome metrics was employed, hampering comparisons across studies. A comparison of the CNN performance against an independent test group of dentists was provided by seven studies; most studies found the CNN to perform similar to dentists. Applicability or impact on treatment decision was not assessed at all.
Conclusions
CNNs are increasingly employed for dental image diagnostics in research settings. Their usefulness, safety and generalizability should be demonstrated using more rigorous, replicable and comparable methodology.
Clinical significance
CNNs may be used in diagnostic-assistance systems, thereby assisting dentists in a more comprehensive, systematic and faster evaluation and documentation of dental images. CNNs may become applicable in routine care; however, prior to that, the dental community should appraise them against the rules of evidence-based practice.}

This is because individual patient biology is unique, and employing a single approach for all is inefficient. A crucial step for customizing radiotherapy planning and gaining fundamental information about the disease, is the identification and delineation of targeted structures. However, accurate biomedical image segmentation is time-consuming, requires considerable experience and is prone to observer variability. In the past decade, the use of deep learning models has significantly increased in the field of medical image segmentation. At present, a vast number of anatomical structures can be demarcated on a clinician’s level with deep learning models. These models would not only unload work, but they can offer unbiased characterization of the disease. The main architectures used in segmentation are the U-Net and its variants, that exhibit outstanding performances. However, reproducing results or directly comparing methods is often limited by closed source of data and the large heterogeneity among medical images. With this in mind, our intention is to provide a reliable source for assessing deep learning models. As an example, we chose the challenging task of delineating the prostate gland in multi-modal images. First, this paper provides a comprehensive review of current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for 3D prostate segmentation. Second, utilizing public and in-house CT and MR datasets of varying properties, we created a framework for an objective comparison of automatic prostate segmentation algorithms. The framework was used for rigorous evaluations of the models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.}

DL architectures excel in computer vision tasks, and in particular image processing and interpretation. This has prompted a wave of disruptingly innovative applications in medical imaging, where DL strategies have the potential to vastly outperform human experts. This is particularly relevant in the context of histopathology, where whole slide imaging (WSI) of stained tissue in conjuction with DL algorithms for their interpretation, selection and cancer staging are beginning to play an ever increasing role in supporting human operators in visual assessments. This has the potential to reduce everyday workload as well as to increase precision and reproducibility across observers, centers, staining techniques and even pathologies. In this paper we introduce the most common DL architectures used in image analysis, with a focus on histopathological image analysis in general and in breast histology in particular. We briefly review how, state-of-art DL architectures compare to human performance on across a number of critical tasks such as mitotic count, tubules analysis and nuclear pleomorphism analysis. Also, the development of DL algorithms specialized to pathology images have been enormously fueled by a number of world-wide challenges based on large, multicentric image databases which are now publicly available. In turn, this has allowed most recent efforts to shift more and more towards semi-supervised learning methods, which provide greater flexibility and applicability. We also review all major repositories of manually labelled pathology images in breast cancer and provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges specific to training DL architectures to interpret WSI data, as well as a review of the state-of-the-art methods for interpretation of images generated from immunohistochemical analysis of breast lesions. We finally discuss the future challenges and opportunities which the adoption of DL paradigms is most likely to pose in the field of pathology for breast cancer detection, diagnosis, staging and prognosis. This review is intended as a comprehensive stepping stone into the field of modern computational pathology for a transdisciplinary readership across technical and medical disciplines.}

Therefore, the aim of this work is to classify state-of-arts on ML techniques for brain stroke into 4 categories based on their functionalities or similarity, and then review studies of each category systematically. A total of 39 studies were identified from the results of ScienceDirect web scientific database on ML for brain stroke from the year 2007 to 2019. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is obtained as optimal models in 10 studies for stroke problems. Besides, maximum studies are found in stroke diagnosis although number for stroke treatment is least thus, it identifies a research gap for further investigation. Similarly, CT images are a frequently used dataset in stroke. Finally SVM and Random Forests are efficient techniques used under each category. The present study showcases the contribution of various ML approaches applied to brain stroke.}

This review explores the application of radiomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. While radiomics literature often focuses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), this review also covers its broader application in nuclear medicine, with use cases of positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radiomics. Additionally, we review integrated radiomics, where features from multiple imaging modalities are fused to improve model performance. This review also highlights the growing integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence and the need for feature standardisation and reproducibility to facilitate its translation into clinical practice.}

Clinical oncology is experiencing rapid growth in data that are collected to enhance cancer care. With recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), there is now a computational basis to integrate and synthesize this growing body of multi-dimensional data, deduce patterns, and predict outcomes to improve shared patient and clinician decision making. While there is high potential, significant challenges remain. In this perspective, we propose a pathway of clinical cancer care touchpoints for narrow-task AI applications and review a selection of applications. We describe the challenges faced in the clinical translation of AI and propose solutions. We also suggest paths forward in weaving AI into individualized patient care, with an emphasis on clinical validity, utility, and usability. By illuminating these issues in the context of current AI applications for clinical oncology, we hope to help advance meaningful investigations that will ultimately translate to real-world clinical use.}

This systematic review evaluates the role of these technologies in improving diversity, particularly in racial, ethnic, gender, age, and socioeconomic dimensions, minimizing bias, and allowing personalized medicine in clinical research settings. Evidence from 90 studies reveals that digital twins offer dynamic simulation capabilities for trial design, while AI facilitates predictive analytics and recruitment optimization. However, implementation remains hindered by fragmented regulatory frameworks, biased datasets, and infrastructural disparities. Ethical concerns,including privacy, consent, and algorithmic opacity, further complicate the deployment. Inclusive data practices identified in the literature include the use of demographically representative training data, participatory data collection frameworks, and equity audits to detect and correct systemic bias. Fairness in AI and DT models is primarily operationalized through group fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds, along with fairness, aware model training and validation. Key gaps include the lack of global standards, underrepresentation in model training, and challenges in real-world adoption. To overcome these barriers, the review proposes actionable directions: developing inclusive data practices, harmonizing regulatory oversight, and embedding fairness into computational model design. By focusing on diversity as a design principle, AI and DT technologies can support a more equitable and generalizable future for clinical research.}

This paper first reviews the present literature and identifies the possible classes of GenAI that can be applied to toxicology. A generalized and holistic visualization of various toxicological processes powered by GenAI is presented in tandem. The paper discussed toxicological risk assessment and management, spotlighting how global agencies and organizations are forming policies to standardize and regulate AI-related development, such as GenAI, in these fields. The paper identifies and discusses the advantages and challenges of GenAI in toxicology. Further, the paper outlines how GenAI empowers Conversational-AI, which will be critical for highly tailored toxicological solutions. This review will help to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impacts and future potential of GenAI in the field of toxicology.

Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) requires extensive preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative imaging for planning, surveillance, and detection of endo-leaks. There have been manyadvancements in imaging modalities to achieve this purpose. This review discussed different imaging modalities used at different stages of treatment of complex EVAR.
Methods
We conducted a literature review of all the imaging modalities utilized in EVAR by searching various databases.
Results
Preoperative techniques include analysis of images obtained via modified central line using analysis software and intravascular ultrasound. Fusion imaging (FI), carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and Fiber Optic RealShape (FORS) technology have been crucial in obtaining real-time imaging for the detection of endo-leaks during operative procedures. Conventional imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography are still employed for postoperative surveillance along with computational fluid dynamics and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have been the breakthrough in developing robust imaging applications.
Conclusions
This review explains the advantages, disadvantages, and side-effect profile of the abovementioned imaging modalities.}

In contrast, aviation has evolved into a highly structured, automated, and predictive safety system, achieving near-zero accident rates through standardization, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision making. While medicine has incorporated certain aviation-inspired practices—such as checklists, crew resource management, and simulation training—it lacks the comprehensive data-driven framework and continuous oversight that underpins aviation’s safety culture. This perspective proposes a four-phase roadmap for integrating AI into health care, drawing on lessons from aviation’s transformation over the past century. Phase I emphasizes the standardization of clinical data and interoperability, mirroring aviation’s shift from handwritten logs to digital flight recorders. Phase II introduces AI-assisted decision support, paralleling the emergence of autopilot and early flight control systems. Phase III highlights real-time predictive monitoring, analogous to continuous flight data monitoring, while phase IV envisions autonomous health care systems, reflecting modern aircraft’s capacity for automated flight. However, aviation’s experience also reveals the perils of over-reliance on technology, including automation bias and deskilling, underscoring the need for regulatory adaptation, transparent error reporting, and robust human–AI collaboration. By integrating these safeguards, medicine can carefully integrate AI’s transformative potential to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and enhance patient outcomes, thereby shifting from an intuition-driven model to one of precision and reliability.}

While the fundamental concept of tissue slide analysis has stayed the same, our interaction with the microscope is undergoing significant changes. Digital pathology (DP) has gained momentum in veterinary science and is on the verge of becoming a vital tool in diagnostics, research and education. Many diagnostic laboratories have incorporated DP as a critical part of their workflows. Innovations in DP and whole slide image technology have made telediagnosis (the process of transmitting digital clinical data using telecommunication networks for distant diagnosis) more accessible, leading to improved patient care through streamlining of workflows and greater accessibility of second opinions. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence and human-in-the-loop protocols for DP workflows will further the development of computer-aided diagnosis and prognostic tools. Despite its present weaknesses, DP will progressively aid veterinary clinicians and pathologists in delivering more accurate and reliable diagnoses. Consistent incorporation of DP frontline advancements into routine veterinary diagnostic pipelines will assist in improving current tools and help prepare pathologists for the progression of digitalization in the field.}

abstract = {Objective:
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which integrate multiple data modalities beyond text. Although MLLMs show promise, there is a gap in the literature that empirically demonstrates their impact in healthcare. This paper summarizes the applications of MLLMs in healthcare, highlighting their potential to transform health practices.
Methods:
A rapid literature review was conducted in August 2024 using World Health Organization (WHO) rapid-review methodology and PRISMA standards, with searches across four databases (Scopus, Medline, PubMed and ACM Digital Library) and top-tier conferences—including NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, MICCAI, CVPR, ACL and EMNLP. Articles on MLLMs healthcare applications were included for analysis based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results:
The search yielded 115 articles, 39 included in the final analysis. Of these, 77% appeared online (preprints and published) in 2024, reflecting the emergence of MLLMs. 80% of studies were from Asia and North America (mainly China and US), with Europe lagging. Studies split evenly between pre-built MLLMs evaluations (60% focused on GPT versions) and custom MLLMs/frameworks development with task-specific customizations. About 81% of studies examined MLLMs for diagnosis and reporting in radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology, with additional applications in education, surgery, and mental health. Prompting strategies, used in 80% of studies, improved performance in nearly half. However, evaluation practices were inconsistent with 67% reported accuracy. Error analysis was mostly anecdotal, with only 18% categorized failure types. Only 13% validated explainability through clinician feedback. Clinical deployment was demonstrated in just 3% of studies, and workflow integration, governance, and safety were rarely addressed.
Discussion and Conclusion:
MLLMs offer substantial potential for healthcare transformation through multimodal data integration. Yet, methodological inconsistencies, limited validation, and underdeveloped deployment strategies highlight the need for standardized evaluation metrics, structured error analysis, and human-centered design to support safe, scalable, and trustworthy clinical adoption.}

OpenAI created this AI language model called ChatGPT. It is built using the GPT architecture and is trained on a large corpus of text data to respond to natural language inquiries that resemble a person’s requirements. This technology has lots of applications in healthcare. The need for accurate and current data is one of the major obstacles to adopting ChatGPT in healthcare. GPT must have access to precise and up-to-date medical data to provide trustworthy suggestions and treatment options. It might be accomplished by ensuring that the data used by GPT is received from reliable sources and that the data is updated regularly. Since sensitive medical information would be involved, it will also be crucial to consider privacy and security issues while utilising GPT in the healthcare industry. This paper briefs about ChatGPT and its need for healthcare, its significant Work Flow Dimensions and typical features of ChatGPT for the Healthcare domain. Finally, it identified and discussed significant applications of ChatGPT for healthcare. ChatGPT can comprehend the conversational context and provide contextually appropriate replies. Its effectiveness as a conversational AI tool makes it useful for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications. However, we see many limitations in medical ethics, data interpretation, accountability and other issues related to the privacy. Regarding specialised tasks like text creation, language translation, text categorisation, text summarisation, and creating conversation systems, ChatGPT has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, and somewhat satisfactory results can be expected. Moreover, it can also be utilised for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) activities, including sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity identification.}

abstract = {Background
There has been a substantial increase in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for clinical decision support. Historically, these were mostly knowledge-based systems, but recent advances include non–knowledge-based systems using some form of machine learning. The ability of health care professionals to trust technology and understand how it benefits patients or improves care delivery is known to be important for their adoption of that technology. For non–knowledge-based AI tools for clinical decision support, these issues are poorly understood.
Objective
The aim of this study is to qualitatively synthesize evidence on the experiences of health care professionals in routinely using non–knowledge-based AI tools to support their clinical decision-making.
Methods
In June 2023, we searched 4 electronic databases, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science, with no language or date limit. We also contacted relevant experts and searched reference lists of the included studies. We included studies of any design that reported the experiences of health care professionals using non–knowledge-based systems for clinical decision support in their work settings. We completed double independent quality assessment for all included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We used a theoretically informed thematic approach to synthesize the findings.
Results
After screening 7552 titles and 182 full-text articles, we included 25 studies conducted in 9 different countries. Most of the included studies were qualitative (n=13), and the remaining were quantitative (n=9) and mixed methods (n=3). Overall, we identified 7 themes: health care professionals’ understanding of AI applications, level of trust and confidence in AI tools, judging the value added by AI, data availability and limitations of AI, time and competing priorities, concern about governance, and collaboration to facilitate the implementation and use of AI. The most frequently occurring are the first 3 themes. For example, many studies reported that health care professionals were concerned about not understanding the AI outputs or the rationale behind them. There were issues with confidence in the accuracy of the AI applications and their recommendations. Some health care professionals believed that AI provided added value and improved decision-making, and some reported that it only served as a confirmation of their clinical judgment, while others did not find it useful at all.
Conclusions
Our review identified several important issues documented in various studies on health care professionals’ use of AI tools in real-world health care settings. Opinions of health care professionals regarding the added value of AI tools for supporting clinical decision-making varied widely, and many professionals had concerns about their understanding of and trust in this technology. The findings of this review emphasize the need for concerted efforts to optimize the integration of AI tools in real-world health care settings.

abstract = {Objective
The timely reporting of critical results in radiology is paramount to improved patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence has the ability to improve quality by optimizing clinical radiology workflows. We sought to determine the impact of a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved machine learning (ML) algorithm, meant to mark computed tomography (CT) head examinations pending interpretation as higher probability for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), on metrics across our healthcare system. We hypothesized that ML is associated with a reduction in report turnaround time (RTAT) and length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) and inpatient populations.
Materials and Methods
An ML algorithm was incorporated across CT scanners at imaging sites in January 2018. RTAT and LOS were derived for reports and patients between July 2017 and December 2017 prior to implementation of ML and compared to those between January 2018 and June 2018 after implementation of ML. A total of 25,658 and 24,996 ED and inpatient cases were evaluated across the entire healthcare system before and after ML, respectively.
Results
RTAT decreased from 75 to 69 minutes (P <0.001) at all facilities in the healthcare system. At the level 1 trauma center specifically, RTAT decreased from 67 to 59 minutes (P <0.001). ED LOS decreased from 471 to 425 minutes (P <0.001) for patients without ICH, and from 527 to 491 minutes for those with ICH (P = 0.456). Inpatient LOS decreased from 18.4 to 15.8 days for those without ICH (P = 0.001) and 18.1 to 15.8 days for those with ICH (P = 0.02).
Conclusion
We demonstrated that utilization of ML was associated with a statistically significant decrease in RTAT. There was also a significant decrease in LOS for ED patients without ICH, but not for ED patients with ICH. Further evaluation of the impact of such tools on patient care and outcomes is needed.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has an astonishing potential in assisting clinical decision making and revolutionizing the field of health care. A major open challenge that AI will need to address before its integration in the clinical routine is that of algorithmic bias. Most AI algorithms need big datasets to learn from, but several groups of the human population have a long history of being absent or misrepresented in existing biomedical datasets. If the training data is misrepresentative of the population variability, AI is prone to reinforcing bias, which can lead to fatal outcomes, misdiagnoses, and lack of generalization. Here, we describe the challenges in rendering AI algorithms fairer, and we propose concrete steps for addressing bias using tools from the field of open science.}

Radiomics, a technique that extracts quantitative features, has emerged as a promising approach for improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting treatment response. This review explores the current status of radiomics-based applications derived from neuroimaging and AI in addressing various mental disorders categorized under the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). These include bipolar and anxiety disorders, depressive and neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia spectrum and other psychosis, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Internet Gaming Disorder. The findings highlight the critical role of radiomic features and identify the brain regions associated with each disorder, alongside the tools, algorithms, and methodologies used. While the review also discusses limitations and challenges in radiomics research, it underscores the potential of radiomics and AI to identify significant biomarkers for the precise diagnosis of mental health conditions, as well as to enhance precision in treatment response. The potential of this technology could offer new approaches for the diagnosis and personalized treatment of mental disorders, ultimately improving the well-being of millions people worldwide.}

Simultaneously, healthcare data underlies strict data privacy rules, hindering the creation of large datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm addressing this dilemma, by allowing separate institutions to collaborate in a training process while keeping each institution's data private and exchanging model parameters instead. In this study, we identify and review key developments of FL for CPATH applications. We consider 15 studies, thereby evaluating the current status of exploring and adapting this emerging technology for CPATH applications. Proof-of-concept studies have been conducted across a wide range of CPATH use cases, showcasing the performance equivalency of models trained in a federated compared to a centralized manner. Six studies focus on model aggregation or model alignment methods reporting minor (0∼3%) performance improvement compared to conventional FL techniques, while four studies explore domain alignment methods, resulting in more significant performance improvements (4∼20%). To further reduce the privacy risk posed by sharing model parameters, four studies investigated the use of privacy preservation methods, where all methods demonstrated equivalent or slightly degraded performance (0.2∼6% lower). To facilitate broader, real-world environment adoption, it is imperative to establish guidelines for the setup and deployment of FL infrastructure, alongside the promotion of standardized software frameworks. These steps are crucial to 1) further democratize CPATH research by allowing smaller institutions to pool data and computational resources 2) investigating rare diseases, 3) conducting multi-institutional studies, and 4) allowing rapid prototyping on private data.}

abstract = {Background
Primary health care (PHC) is critical for delivering accessible and continuous care but faces persistent challenges such as workforce shortages, administrative burden, and rising multimorbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support PHC by enhancing diagnosis, workflow efficiency, and clinical decision-making. However, existing research often overlooks how AI tools function within the complex realities of primary care and how clinicians and patients experience them.
Objective
This scoping review maps the landscape of AI applications in PHC, with a focus on empirical studies involving direct engagement from PHC stakeholders. The review emphasizes real-world settings, clinical workflows, and the alignment of AI tools with the values and complexity of generalist care.
Methods
Following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to April 13, 2024. Inclusion criteria were empirical, peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2010 and April 2024, involving direct stakeholder interaction (general practitioners, nurses, or patients) in real-world PHC settings, evaluating AI applications (eg, diagnostics, workflow optimization, and documentation). Exclusions included algorithm-only validations, pediatric populations, secondary or tertiary care contexts not explicitly addressing PHC workflows, nonempirical research (eg, editorials or protocols), and non-English studies. We used thematic analysis to synthesize findings related to study aims, AI applications, and stakeholder roles.
Results
Of 5224 identified records, 73 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were grouped into four main themes: (1) early intervention and decision support (n=21; 29%), (2) chronic disease management (n=16; 22%), (3) operations and patient management (n=12; 16%), and (4) acceptance and implementation experiences (n=24; 33%). AI tools frequently demonstrated strong technical accuracy, particularly in diagnostic decision support. However, implementation in routine practice was often limited by usability barriers, workflow misalignment, trust concerns, equity gaps, and financial constraints.
Conclusions
Overall, AI holds significant potential to support PHC, especially when aligned with clinical reasoning, workflow needs, and relational care models. However, persistent implementation barriers such as usability challenges, training gaps, and workflow integration issues must be addressed. The evidence included in this review is limited by heterogeneity in study design and the predominance of small-scale feasibility studies. Future research should prioritize pragmatic trials, co-design with PHC professionals, and anticipatory planning using future methods to ensure responsible and equitable implementation.}

abstract = {Background
Prenatal detection of congenital heart defects (CHD) depends heavily on operator skill. OB/GYN residents are primary providers of screening, yet training in fetal echocardiography is heterogeneous and frequently insufficient, contributing to suboptimal detection in routine care.
Objective
To synthesize current evidence and practice on educating OB/GYN residents in fetal echocardiography, evaluate educational modalities (didactics, mentorship, simulation, e-learning), identify gaps, and propose curriculum recommendations.
Methods
Narrative review of European and international guidelines, training surveys, and empirical studies on ultrasound education with emphasis on fetal cardiac screening. Sources included society curricula (e.g., ISUOG, FMF, national colleges), multicenter training initiatives, simulation trials, and competency-based education literature. Findings were organized along the IMRaD structure and triangulated to derive practical recommendations.
Results
Training structures vary widely in objectives, volume requirements, supervision, and assessment. Successful national/regional programs show that targeted workforce training can raise antenatal CHD detection and improve neonatal outcomes. High-fidelity simulation consistently accelerates skill acquisition: novices achieved > 95 % correct standard fetal cardiac views within two weeks and matched or exceeded untrained physicians’ scanning times after six weeks. Blended models that combine structured didactics (FMF/ISUOG), deliberate simulator practice with guided feedback, mentored clinical scanning, and case-based e-learning yield the most reliable gains. Persistent barriers include limited protected time, uneven instructor expertise, scarce access to simulators, ethical/logistical constraints for hands-on practice, and inadequate competency assessment tools.
Conclusions
A standardized, competency-based curriculum for OB/GYN residents—embedding mandatory theoretical modules, simulation-based milestones, supervised clinical logbooks with image portfolios, and objective practical assessments—can meaningfully elevate fetal echocardiography proficiency and, by extension, CHD detection in routine obstetric care. Implementation should be supported by faculty development, regional simulation networks, and continuous quality improvement linking training metrics to clinical outcomes.}

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their potential in dental clinical healthcare and education has become increasingly evident. However, the application of this emerging technology within dental education has not yet been systematically reviewed. This scoping review aims to summarize current applications, identify challenges encountered in the implementation process, and outline future prospects.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify studies related to LLMs and dental education. Relevant studies were screened, selected, and subjected to data extraction to collate information pertinent to the research questions.
Results
A total of 37 studies were included. LLMs have been applied across seven distinct domains in dental education, notably in dental examinations (n = 24), educational information resources (n = 5), and assessment of students’ assignments (n = 3). These applications have introduced several challenges, including technical issues (ie, inaccurate information, inability in image analysis, inaccessibility, and high cost) and application aspects (ie, ethical issues, absence of usage guidelines, potential harm to students’ knowledge and skills, and cautious attitudes towards LLMs). Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts from students, educators, curriculum administrators, and technical developers.
Conclusions
The application of LLMs in dental education remains in its early stage. Future research should focus on expanding the range of applications and establishing standardized, ethically satisfying, and technically sound guidelines for integrating LLMs into dental education.}

Among the rapid integration of artificial intelligence in clinical settings, large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4, have emerged as multifaceted tools that have potential for health-care delivery, diagnosis, and patient care. However, deployment of LLMs raises substantial regulatory and safety concerns. Due to their high output variability, poor inherent explainability, and the risk of so-called AI hallucinations, LLM-based health-care applications that serve a medical purpose face regulatory challenges for approval as medical devices under US and EU laws, including the recently passed EU Artificial Intelligence Act. Despite unaddressed risks for patients, including misdiagnosis and unverified medical advice, such applications are available on the market. The regulatory ambiguity surrounding these tools creates an urgent need for frameworks that accommodate their unique capabilities and limitations. Alongside the development of these frameworks, existing regulations should be enforced. If regulators fear enforcing the regulations in a market dominated by supply or development by large technology companies, the consequences of layperson harm will force belated action, damaging the potentiality of LLM-based applications for layperson medical advice.}

A rapid review of the literature was conducted in six electronic databases published from 2015 through 2020. The process of data extraction was documented using a PRISMA flowchart for inclusion and exclusion of studies. As a result, the literature search identified 1.733 articles, from which 16 articles were included in the review. We developed an updated taxonomy and identified challenges, open questions, and current data types. Our taxonomy and discussion contribute with a significant degree of coverage from subjects related to the use of machine learning to improve telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence identified by this rapid review suggests that machine learning, in combination with telemedicine, can provide a strategy to control outbreaks by providing smart triage of patients and remote monitoring. Also, the use of telemedicine during future outbreaks could be further explored and refined.}

We categorise these challenges into (a) data scarcity and imbalance, (b) data access and privacy, (c) data annotation and segmentation, (d) cancer detection and diagnosis, and (e) tumour profiling, treatment planning and monitoring. Based on our analysis of 164 publications that apply adversarial training techniques in the context of cancer imaging, we highlight multiple underexplored solutions with research potential. We further contribute the Synthesis Study Trustworthiness Test (SynTRUST), a meta-analysis framework for assessing the validation rigour of medical image synthesis studies. SynTRUST is based on 26 concrete measures of thoroughness, reproducibility, usefulness, scalability, and tenability. Based on SynTRUST, we analyse 16 of the most promising cancer imaging challenge solutions and observe a high validation rigour in general, but also several desirable improvements. With this work, we strive to bridge the gap between the needs of the clinical cancer imaging community and the current and prospective research on data synthesis and adversarial networks in the artificial intelligence community.}

CADe has the potential to decrease the polyp miss rate, contributing to improving adenoma detection, whereas CADx can improve the accuracy of colorectal polyp optical diagnosis, leading to reduction of unnecessary polypectomy of non-neoplastic lesions, potential implementation of a resect-and-discard paradigm, and proper application of advanced resection techniques.

However, the quality of the developed AI systems as well as that of the study designs vary significantly, hence raising some concerns regarding the generalization of the proposed AI systems. Initial studies were conducted in an exploratory or retrospective fashion by using stored images and likely overestimating the results.

It was first rampant in early 2019 and so far, 539 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. This is reminiscent of the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, we can detect the infected cases of COVID-19 by analysing either X-rays or CT, which are presumably considered the least expensive methods. In the existence of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which integrate image pre-processing techniques with fully connected layers, we can develop a sophisticated AI system contingent on various pre-trained models. Each pre-trained model we involved in our study assumed its role in extracting some specific features from different chest image datasets in many verified sources, such as (Mendeley, Kaggle, and GitHub). First, for CXR datasets associated with the CNN trained model from the beginning, whereby is comprised of four layers beginning with the Conv2D layer, which comprises 32 filters, followed by the MaxPooling and afterwards, we reiterated similarly. We used two techniques to avoid overgeneralization, the early stopping and the Dropout techniques. After all, the output was one neuron to classify both cases of 0 or 1, followed by a sigmoid function; in addition, we used the Adam optimizer owing to the more improved outcomes than what other optimizers conducted; ultimately, we referred to our findings by using a confusion matrix, classification report (Recall & Precision), sensitivity and specificity; in this approach, we achieved a classification accuracy of 96%. Our three integrated pre-trained models (VGG16, DenseNet201, and DenseNet121) yielded a remarkable test accuracy of 98.81%. Besides, our merged models (VGG16, DenseNet201) trained on CT images with the utmost effort; this model held an accurate test of 99.73% for binary classification with the (Normal/Covid-19) scenario. Comparing our results with related studies shows that our proposed models were superior to the previous CNN machine learning models in terms of various performance metrics. Our pre-trained model associated with the CT dataset achieved 100% of the F1score and the loss value was approximately 0.00268.}

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in many areas of health care. Its use in infection management is catching up as identified in a recent review in this journal. We present here a complementary review to this work.
Objectives
To support clinicians and researchers in navigating through the methodological aspects of ML approaches in the field of infection management.
Sources
A Medline search was performed with the keywords artificial intelligence, machine learning, infection∗, and infectious disease∗ for the years 2014–2019. Studies using routinely available electronic hospital record data from an inpatient setting with a focus on bacterial and fungal infections were included.
Content
Fifty-two studies were included and divided into six groups based on their focus. These studies covered detection/prediction of sepsis (n = 19), hospital-acquired infections (n = 11), surgical site infections and other postoperative infections (n = 11), microbiological test results (n = 4), infections in general (n = 2), musculoskeletal infections (n = 2), and other topics (urinary tract infections, deep fungal infections, antimicrobial prescriptions; n = 1 each). In total, 35 different ML techniques were used. Logistic regression was applied in 18 studies followed by random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks in 18, 12, and seven studies, respectively. Overall, the studies were very heterogeneous in their approach and their reporting. Detailed information on data handling and software code was often missing. Validation on new datasets and/or in other institutions was rarely done. Clinical studies on the impact of ML in infection management were lacking.
Implications
Promising approaches for ML use in infectious diseases were identified. But building trust in these new technologies will require improved reporting. Explainability and interpretability of the models used were rarely addressed and should be further explored. Independent model validation and clinical studies evaluating the added value of ML approaches are needed.}

The fundamental principle of radiomics is the hypothesis that biomedical images contain predictive information, not discernible to the human eye, that can be mined through quantitative image analysis. In this review, a general outline of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) will be provided, along with prominent use cases in immunotherapy (e.g. response and adverse event prediction) and targeted therapy (i.e. radiogenomics). While the increased use and development of radiomics and AI in immuno-oncology is highly promising, the technology is still in its early stages, and different challenges still need to be overcome.

This is a narrative review article in which we have described recent developments in severity evaluation of knee OA from X-ray images. We have primarily focussed on automatic analysis and have reviewed articles in which machine learning, transfer learning, active learning, etc. have been employed on X-ray images to access and classify the severity of knee OA.
Methods
All original research articles on OA detection and classification using X-ray images published in English were searched on PubMed database, Google Scholar, RSNA radiology databases in year 2019. The search terms of “knee Osteoarthritis” were combined with search terms “Machine Learning”, ‘severity” and “X-ray”.
Results
The initial search on various publication databases revealed a total of 743 results, out of which only 26 articles were considered relevant to radiographic knee OA severity analysis. The majority of the articles were based on automatic analysis. Manual segmentation based articles were least in numbers.
Conclusion
Computer aided methods to diagnose knee OA are great tools to detect OA at ealry stages. Advancements in Human Computer Interface systems have led the researchers to bridge the gap between machine learning algorithms and expert healthcare professionals to provide better and timely treatment options to the knee OA affected patients.}

We discuss recent developments in the field of ML relevant to CMR in the areas of image acquisition & reconstruction, image analysis, diagnostic evaluation and derivation of prognostic information. To date, the main impact of ML in CMR has been to significantly reduce the time required for image segmentation and analysis. Accurate and reproducible fully automated quantification of left and right ventricular mass and volume is now available in commercial products. Active research areas include reduction of image acquisition and reconstruction time, improving spatial and temporal resolution, and analysis of perfusion and myocardial mapping. Although large cohort studies are providing valuable data sets for ML training, care must be taken in extending applications to specific patient groups. Since ML algorithms can fail in unpredictable ways, it is important to mitigate this by open source publication of computational processes and datasets. Furthermore, controlled trials are needed to evaluate methods across multiple centers and patient groups.}

abstract = {Summary
The digital twin (DT) is a concept widely used in industry to create digital replicas of physical objects or systems. The dynamic, bi-directional link between the physical entity and its digital counterpart enables a real-time update of the digital entity. It can predict perturbations related to the physical object’s function. The obvious applications of DTs in healthcare and medicine are extremely attractive prospects that have the potential to revolutionize patient diagnosis and treatment. However, challenges including technical obstacles, biological heterogeneity, and ethical considerations make it difficult to achieve the desired goal. Advances in multi-modal deep learning methods, embodied AI agents, and the metaverse may mitigate some difficulties. Here, we discuss the basic concepts underlying DTs, the requirements for implementing DTs in medicine, and their current and potential healthcare uses. We also provide our perspective on five hallmarks for a healthcare DT system to advance research in this field.}

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), an emerging technique for blood-pool imaging, enables assessment of microvascular perfusion in breast lesions and addresses limitations of conventional ultrasound. Although CEUS plays an increasingly important role in breast cancer diagnosis, a comprehensive bibliometric evaluation of CEUS research in breast oncology has not yet been undertaken. This study applied bibliometric analysis to delineate the developmental trajectory of CEUS in breast cancer, identify prevailing research hotspots, and anticipate future directions. Using publications retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (1996 to May 2025), we conducted a systematic assessment of co-authorship patterns; institutional and national collaboration networks; journal and author productivity; and keyword co-occurrence and clustering. In total, 503 publications met the inclusion criteria, with annual output accelerating notably since 2020. China and the United States were the principal contributors, both in publication volume and collaborative partnerships. Forsberg Flemming and the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine were identified as the most prolific author and journal, respectively. Thematic cluster analysis highlighted key research domains, including optimization of microbubble agents, diagnostic performance, treatment response monitoring and integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Collectively, these trends indicate the field’s progression from a primarily diagnostic modality toward predictive, therapeutic, and real-time AI-enabled applications driven by ongoing technological innovation.}

In this context, automation of diagnostic procedures can improve the entire pipeline, which comprises patient registration, planning and performing an imaging examination at the scanner, image reconstruction, image analysis, and feeding the diagnostic information from various sources into decision support systems. With a focus on cancer diagnostics, this review article reports and discusses how computer-assistance can be integrated into diagnostic procedures and which benefits and challenges arise from it. Besides a strong view on classical imaging modalities like x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET, SPECT and hybrid imaging devices thereof, it is outlined how imaging data can be combined with data deriving from patient anamnesis, clinical chemistry, pathology, and different omics. In this context, the article also discusses IT infrastructures that are required to realize this integration in the clinical routine.

abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) is a growing field in medicine. This narrative review describes the current body of literature on ML for clinical decision support in infectious diseases (ID).
Objectives
We aim to inform clinicians about the use of ML for diagnosis, classification, outcome prediction and antimicrobial management in ID.
Sources
References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, ACM Digital Library, arXiV and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to July 2019.
Content
We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%). Fifty-three ML-CDSS (88%) were developed using data from high-income countries and seven (12%) with data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The evaluation of ML-CDSS was limited to measures of performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity) for 57 ML-CDSS (95%) and included data in clinical practice for three (5%).
Implications
Considering comprehensive patient data from socioeconomically diverse healthcare settings, including primary care and LMICs, may improve the ability of ML-CDSS to suggest decisions adapted to various clinical contexts. Currents gaps identified in the evaluation of ML-CDSS must also be addressed in order to know the potential impact of such tools for clinicians and patients.}

Considering the growing intersection of biobanks, artificial intelligence (AI) and omics research, and their critical impact on public health, this study aimed to explore the current and future public health implications and challenges of AI and omics-driven innovations in biobanking.
Study design
Narrative literature review.
Methods
A structured literature search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and IEEExplore databases using relevant search terms. Additional references were identified through backward and forward citation chaining. Key themes were aggregated and analysed through thematic analysis.
Results
Thirty-seven studies were selected for analysis, leading to the identification and categorisation of key developments. Several key technical, ethical and implementation challenges were also identified, including AI model selection, data accessibility, variability and quality issues, lack of robust and standardised validation methods, explainability, accountability, lack of transparency, algorithmic bias, privacy, security and fairness issues, and governance model selection. Based on these results, potential future scenarios of AI and omics integration in biobanking and their related public health implications were considered.
Conclusions
While AI and omics-driven innovations in biobanking offer specific transformative public health benefits, addressing their technical, ethical and implementation challenges is crucial. Robust regulatory frameworks, feasible governance models, access to quality data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and transparent and validated AI systems are essential to maximise benefits and mitigate risks. Further research and policy development are needed to support the responsible integration of these technologies in biobanking and public health.}

Interventions such as thrombolytics and mechanical thrombectomy improve patient outcomes after stroke in selected patients; however, significant gaps remain in our ability to select patients, predict complications, and understand outcomes. Big data and the computational methods needed to analyze it can address these gaps. For example, automated analysis of neuroimaging to estimate the volume of brain tissue that is ischemic and salvageable can help triage patients for acute interventions. Data-intensive computational techniques can perform complex risk calculations that are too cumbersome to be completed by humans, resulting in more accurate and timely prediction of which patients require increased vigilance for adverse events such as treatment complications. To handle the accumulation of complex medical data, a variety of advanced computational techniques referred to as machine learning and artificial intelligence now routinely complement traditional statistical inference. In this narrative review, we explore data-intensive techniques in stroke research, how it has informed the management of stroke patients, and how current work could shape clinical practice in the future.}

abstract = {Objective
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly recognized as a crucial tool in cancer care, with significant potential to enhance diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. However, the holistic integration of XAI across all stages of cancer care remains underexplored. This review addresses this gap by systematically evaluating the role of XAI in these critical areas, identifying key challenges and emerging trends.
Materials and methods
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on publications from January 2020 to May 2024. After rigorous screening and quality assessment, 69 studies were selected for in-depth analysis.
Results
The review identified critical gaps in the application of XAI within cancer care, notably the exclusion of clinicians in 83% of studies, which raises concerns about real-world applicability and may lead to explanations that are technically sound but clinically irrelevant. Additionally, 87% of studies lacked rigorous evaluation of XAI explanations, compromising their reliability in clinical practice. The dominance of post-hoc visual methods like SHAP, LIME and Grad-CAM reflects a trend toward explanations that may be inherently flawed due to specific input perturbations and simplifying assumptions. The lack of formal evaluation metrics and standardization constrains broader XAI adoption in clinical settings, creating a disconnect between AI development and clinical integration. Moreover, translating XAI insights into actionable clinical decisions remains challenging due to the absence of clear guidelines for integrating these tools into clinical workflows.
Conclusion
This review highlights the need for greater clinician involvement, standardized XAI evaluation metrics, clinician-centric interfaces, context-aware XAI systems, and frameworks for integrating XAI into clinical workflows for informed clinical decision-making and improved outcomes in cancer care.}

abstract = {Background and objective
In the medical field, data volume is increasingly growing, and traditional methods cannot manage it efficiently. In biomedical computation, the continuous challenges are: management, analysis, and storage of the biomedical data. Nowadays, big data technology plays a significant role in the management, organization, and analysis of data, using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. It also allows a quick access to data using the NoSQL database. Thus, big data technologies include new frameworks to process medical data in a manner similar to biomedical images. It becomes very important to develop methods and/or architectures based on big data technologies, for a complete processing of biomedical image data.
Method
This paper describes big data analytics for biomedical images, shows examples reported in the literature, briefly discusses new methods used in processing, and offers conclusions. We argue for adapting and extending related work methods in the field of big data software, using Hadoop and Spark frameworks. These provide an optimal and efficient architecture for biomedical image analysis. This paper thus gives a broad overview of big data analytics to automate biomedical image diagnosis. A workflow with optimal methods and algorithm for each step is proposed.
Results
Two architectures for image classification are suggested. We use the Hadoop framework to design the first, and the Spark framework for the second. The proposed Spark architecture allows us to develop appropriate and efficient methods to leverage a large number of images for classification, which can be customized with respect to each other.
Conclusions
The proposed architectures are more complete, easier, and are adaptable in all of the steps from conception. The obtained Spark architecture is the most complete, because it facilitates the implementation of algorithms with its embedded libraries.}

In response, Machine Unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables the selective removal of data influence from trained models. By supporting compliance with privacy regulations (such as the GDPR’s right to be forgotten) and facilitating model refinement, MU holds significant practical and legal value. Additionally, the effective deployment of MU introduces new security concerns. In real-world settings, malicious actors may exploit vulnerabilities in MU mechanisms, such as incomplete or inaccurate data removal, to infer deleted information, reintroduce adversarial behavior, or manipulate model updates. These risks highlight the urgency of understanding how classical ML threats relate to the design and operation of MU systems. However, despite its growing relevance, this intersection remains underexplored. In this article, we present a structured analysis of four major attack classes in ML (Backdoor Attacks, Membership Inference Attacks, Adversarial Attacks, and Inversion Attacks) and examine their implications for MU across multiple dimensions: (i) as direct threats targeting MU mechanisms, (ii) as challenges that MU can potentially mitigate, (iii) as evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness and performance of MU techniques, and (iv) as verification factors to validate the success and completeness of the unlearning process. We note that not all attacks exhibit all these perspectives simultaneously; their relevance varies depending on the attack characteristics and MU scenario. We also propose a novel classification that reflects how these attacks are typically employed in this context. Finally, we identify open challenges, including ethical considerations, and highlight promising directions for future research to advance secure and privacy-preserving Machine Unlearning.}

abstract = {The intersection of mathematical cognition, metacognition, and advanced technologies presents a frontier with profound implications for human learning and artificial intelligence. This paper traces the historical roots of these concepts from the Pythagoreans and Aristotle to modern cognitive science and explores their relevance to contemporary technological applications. We examine how the Pythagoreans' view of mathematics as fundamental to understanding the universe and Aristotle's contributions to logic and categorization have shaped our current understanding of mathematical cognition and metacognition. The paper investigates the role of Boolean logic in computational processes and its relationship to human logical reasoning, as well as the significance of Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic in modelling uncertainty in human cognition and decision-making. We also explore the emerging field of Chemical Artificial Intelligence and its potential applications. We argue for unifying mathematical metacognition with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, while identifying the multifaceted benefits and challenges of such unification. The present paper examines essential research directions for integrating cognitive sciences and advanced technologies, discussing applications in education, healthcare, and business management. We provide suggestions for developing cognitive robots using specific cognitive tasks and explore the ethical implications of these advancements. Our analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to realize the full potential of this integration while mitigating potential risks.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the expanding use of machine learning (ML) in fields such as finance and marketing, its application in the daily practice of clinical medicine is almost non-existent. In this systematic review, we describe the various areas within clinical medicine that have applied the use of ML to improve patient care.
Methods
A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using Medline(R), EBM Reviews, Embase, Psych Info, and Cochrane Databases, focusing on human studies that used ML to directly address a clinical problem. Included studies were published from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2018 and provided metrics on the performance of the utilized ML tool.
Results
A total of 1909 unique publications were reviewed, with 378 retrospective articles and 8 prospective articles meeting inclusion criteria. Retrospective publications were found to be increasing in frequency, with 61 % of articles published within the last 4 years. Prospective articles comprised only 2 % of the articles meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies utilized a prospective cohort design with an average sample size of 531.
Conclusion
The majority of literature describing the use of ML in clinical medicine is retrospective in nature and often outlines proof-of-concept approaches to impact patient care. We postulate that identifying and overcoming key translational barriers, including real-time access to clinical data, data security, physician approval of “black box” generated results, and performance evaluation will allow for a fundamental shift in medical practice, where specialized tools will aid the healthcare team in providing better patient care.}

abstract = {Background and objective
This paper aims to overview multidimensional mining algorithms in relation to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) radiogenomics for computer aided detection and diagnosis of breast tumours. The work also aims to address a new problem in radiogenomics mining: how to combine structural radiomics information with non-structural genomics information for improving the accuracy and efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC).
Methods
This requires the automated extraction of parameters from non-structural breast radiomics data, and finding feature vectors with diagnostic value, which then are combined with genomics data. In order to address the problem of weakly labelled tumour images, a Generative Adiversarial Networks (GAN) based deep learning strategy is proposed for the classification of tumour types; this has significant potential for providing accurate real-time identification of tumorous regions from MRI scans. In order to efficiently integrate in a deep learning framework different features from radiogenomics datasets at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions, pyramid structured and multi-scale densely connected U-Nets are proposed. A bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) combined with an attention based deep learning approach is also proposed.
Results
The aim is to accurately predict NAC responses by combining imaging and genomic datasets. The approaches discussed incorporate some of the latest developments in of current signal processing and artificial intelligence and have significant potential in advancing and provide a development platform for future cutting-edge biomedical radiogenomics analysis.
Conclusions
The association of genotypic and phenotypic features is at the core of the emergent field of Precision Medicine. It makes use of advances in biomedical big data analysis, which enables the correlation between disease-associated phenotypic characteristics, genetics polymorphism and gene activation to be revealed.}

Based on this, this paper first reviews the technological evolution of image–text multimodal models, from early explorations of feature space to visual language encoding structures, and then to the latest large model architectures. Next, from the perspective of technological evolution, we explain how the development of general image–text multimodal technologies promotes the progress of multimodal technologies in the biomedical field, as well as the importance and complexity of specific datasets in the biomedical domain. Then, centered on the tasks of image–text multimodal models, we analyze their common components and challenges. After that, we summarize the architecture, components, and data of general image–text multimodal models, and introduce the applications and improvements of image–text multimodal models in the biomedical field. Finally, we categorize the challenges faced in the development and application of general models into external factors and intrinsic factors, further refining them into 2 external factors and 5 intrinsic factors, and propose targeted solutions, providing guidance for future research directions.

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced in 2018, has revolutionized natural language processing. Its bidirectional understanding of word context has enabled innovative applications, notably in radiology. This study aimed to assess BERT’s influence and applications within the radiologic domain.
Methods
Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed for literature on BERT-based models and natural language processing in radiology from January 1, 2018, to February 12, 2023. The search encompassed keywords related to generative models, transformer architecture, and various imaging techniques.
Results
Of 597 results, 30 met our inclusion criteria. The remaining were unrelated to radiology or did not use BERT-based models. The included studies were retrospective, with 14 published in 2022. The primary focus was on classification and information extraction from radiology reports, with x-rays as the prevalent imaging modality. Specific investigations included automatic CT protocol assignment and deep learning applications in chest x-ray interpretation.
Conclusion
This review underscores the primary application of BERT in radiology for report classification. It also reveals emerging BERT applications for protocol assignment and report generation. As BERT technology advances, we foresee further innovative applications. Its implementation in radiology holds potential for enhancing diagnostic precision, expediting report generation, and optimizing patient care.}

Since medical imaging bear some resemblance to computer vision, it is natural to inquire about the status quo of Transformers in medical imaging and ask the question: can the Transformer models transform medical imaging? In this paper, we attempt to make a response to the inquiry. After a brief introduction of the fundamentals of Transformers, especially in comparison with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and highlighting key defining properties that characterize the Transformers, we offer a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based approaches for medical imaging and exhibit current research progresses made in the areas of medical image segmentation, recognition, detection, registration, reconstruction, enhancement, etc. In particular, what distinguishes our review lies in its organization based on the Transformer’s key defining properties, which are mostly derived from comparing the Transformer and CNN, and its type of architecture, which specifies the manner in which the Transformer and CNN are combined, all helping the readers to best understand the rationale behind the reviewed approaches. We conclude with discussions of future perspectives.}

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and poses challenges for healthcare providers globally. Risk-based approaches for the management of CVD are becoming popular for recommending treatment plans for asymptomatic individuals. Several conventional predictive CVD risk models based do not provide an accurate CVD risk assessment for patients with different baseline risk profiles. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have changed the landscape of CVD risk assessment and demonstrated a better performance when compared against conventional models, mainly due to its ability to handle the input nonlinear variations. Further, it has the flexibility to add risk factors derived from medical imaging modalities that image the morphology of the plaque. The integration of noninvasive carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes with conventional risk factors in the AI framework has further provided stronger power for CVD risk prediction, so-called “integrated predictive CVD risk models.”
Purpose
of the review: The objective of this review is (i) to understand several aspects in the development of predictive CVD risk models, (ii) to explore current conventional predictive risk models and their successes and challenges, and (iii) to refine the search for predictive CVD risk models using noninvasive carotid ultrasound as an exemplar in the artificial intelligence-based framework.
Conclusion
Conventional predictive CVD risk models are suboptimal and could be improved. This review examines the potential to include more noninvasive image-based phenotypes in the CVD risk assessment using powerful AI-based strategies.}

This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap.

We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval.

To complete a scoping review of the literature investigating the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems currently in development for their ability to detect fractures on plain radiographic images.
Methods
A systematic approach was adopted to identify papers for inclusion in this scoping review and utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Statement (PRISMA). Following application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, sixteen studies were included in the final review.
Results
With the exception of one study, all studies report that AI models demonstrated an ability to perform fracture identification tasks on plain skeletal radiographs. Metrics used to report performance are variable throughout all reviewed studies and include area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy. Reported performances for studies indicated AUC values range from AUC 0.78 (weakest) to the best performing system reporting AUC 0.99.
Conclusion
The review found a great variation in the AI model architectures, training and testing methodology as well as the metrics used to report the performance of the networks. A standardisation of the reporting metrics and methods would permit comparison of proposed models and training methods which may accelerate the testing of AI systems in the clinical setting. Prevalence agnostic metrics should be used to reflect the true performance of such systems. Many studies lacked any explainability for the algorithmic decision making of the AI models, and there was a lack of interrogation into the potential reasons for misclassification errors. This type of ‘failure analysis’ would have provided insight into the biases and the aetiology of AI misclassifications.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular, machine learning (ML) has shown promising results in coronary artery disease (CAD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction. Bias in ML systems is of great interest due to its over-performance and poor clinical delivery. The main objective is to understand the nature of risk-of-bias (RoB) in ML and non-ML studies for CVD risk prediction.
Methods
PRISMA model was used to shortlisting 117 studies, which were analyzed to understand the RoB in ML and non-ML using 46 and 32 attributes, respectively. The mean score for each study was computed and then ranked into three ML and non-ML bias categories, namely low-bias (LB), moderate-bias (MB), and high-bias (HB), derived using two cutoffs. Further, bias computation was validated using the analytical slope method.
Results
Five types of the gold standard were identified in the ML design for CAD/CVD risk prediction. The low-moderate and moderate-high bias cutoffs for 24 ML studies (5, 10, and 9 studies for each LB, MB, and HB) and 14 non-ML (3, 4, and 7 studies for each LB, MB, and HB) were in the range of 1.5 to 1.95. BiasML < Biasnon-ML by ∼43%. A set of recommendations were proposed for lowering RoB.
Conclusion
ML showed a lower bias compared to non-ML. For a robust ML-based CAD/CVD prediction design, it is vital to have (i) stronger outcomes like death or CAC score or coronary artery stenosis; (ii) ensuring scientific/clinical validation; (iii) adaptation of multiethnic groups while practicing unseen AI; (iv) amalgamation of conventional, laboratory, image-based and medication-based biomarkers.}

Most of the COVID-19 CT diagnosis methods comprehensively use segmentation and classification tasks. Moreover, most of the review articles are diverse and cover CT as well as X-ray images. Therefore, we focused on the COVID-19 diagnostic methods based on CT images. Well-known search engines and databases such as Google, Google Scholar, Kaggle, Baidu, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus were utilized to collect relevant studies. After deep analysis, we collected 114 studies and reported highly enriched information for each selected research.

In contrast, aviation has evolved into a highly structured, automated, and predictive safety system, achieving near-zero accident rates through standardization, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision making. While medicine has incorporated certain aviation-inspired practices—such as checklists, crew resource management, and simulation training—it lacks the comprehensive data-driven framework and continuous oversight that underpins aviation’s safety culture. This perspective proposes a four-phase roadmap for integrating AI into health care, drawing on lessons from aviation’s transformation over the past century. Phase I emphasizes the standardization of clinical data and interoperability, mirroring aviation’s shift from handwritten logs to digital flight recorders. Phase II introduces AI-assisted decision support, paralleling the emergence of autopilot and early flight control systems. Phase III highlights real-time predictive monitoring, analogous to continuous flight data monitoring, while phase IV envisions autonomous health care systems, reflecting modern aircraft’s capacity for automated flight. However, aviation’s experience also reveals the perils of over-reliance on technology, including automation bias and deskilling, underscoring the need for regulatory adaptation, transparent error reporting, and robust human–AI collaboration. By integrating these safeguards, medicine can carefully integrate AI’s transformative potential to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and enhance patient outcomes, thereby shifting from an intuition-driven model to one of precision and reliability.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice.
Objective
The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.
Results
We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.
Conclusions
This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.}

The limitations associated with algorithms have been largely overcome by the recently released ChatGPT; a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to questions in real-time. Despite the potential benefits, ChatGPT confronts significant limitations to its usefulness in nuclear medicine and radiology. Most notably, ChatGPT is prone to errors and fabrication of information which poses a risk to professionalism, ethics and integrity. These limitations simultaneously undermine the value of ChatGPT to the user by not producing outcomes at the expected standard. Nonetheless, there are a number of exciting applications of ChatGPT in nuclear medicine across education, clinical and research sectors. Assimilation of ChatGPT into practice requires redefining of norms, and re-engineering of information expectations.}

We sought to compare the performance of AI applications in real-world studies to validation study data used to gain regulatory approval.
Methods
We searched PubMed, EBSCO, and EMBASE for publications from 2018 to 2023. We included articles that evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of ICH and LVO detection applications in real-world populations. We performed a quality and applicability assessment using QUADAS-2. We used a bivariate or two univariate meta-analyses, where appropriate, to calculate summary point estimates for sensitivity and specificity.
Results
Eighteen articles met the criteria of the systematic literature review. The included articles evaluated five applications indicated for ICH or LVO triage. Three of the five applications yielded adequate studies to be included in the meta-analysis. For most applications, we did not observe any systematic differences in sensitivity and specificity results between the point estimates from the meta-analysis and the respective 510k studies. For VIZ LVO and RAPID LVO, the 95 % CI for real-world sensitivity sat within the 95 % CI from their respective validation study. For BriefCase ICH, the 95 % CI for real-world sensitivity sat below the 95 % CI of the respective validation study. Additionally, the 95 % CI for real-world specificity for all three of the applications sat within the 95 % CI of their respective validation studies. Data from the individual real-world studies for RAPID ICH and CINA LVO followed a similar trend.
Conclusion
The performance of applications in real-world settings was non-inferior to the performance observed in validation studies used to obtain 510k clearance.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises computational models that mimic the human brain to perform various diagnostic tasks in clinical practice. The aim of this scoping review was to systematically analyze the AI algorithms and models used in endodontics and identify the source quality and type of evidence.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in October 2020 to identify the relevant literature in English language in the 4 major health sciences databases, ie, MEDLINE, Dentistry & Oral Science, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane Library. Our review questions were the following: what are the different AI algorithms and models used in endodontics?, what are the datasets being used?, what type of performance metrics were reported?, and what diagnostic performance measures were used?. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by a modified Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy risk (QUADAS) tool.
Results
Out of 300 studies, 12 articles met our inclusion criteria and were subjected to final analysis. Among the included studies, 6 studies focused on periapical pathology, and 3 studies investigated vertical root fractures. Most studies (n = 10) used neural networks, among which convolutional neural networks were commonly used. The datasets that were mostly studied were radiographs. Out of 12 studies, only 3 studies achieved a high score according to the modified QUADAS tool.
Conclusions
AI models had acceptable performance, ie, accuracy >90% in executing various diagnostic tasks. The scientific reporting of AI-related research is irregular. The endodontic community needs to implement recommended guidelines to improve the weaknesses in the current planning and reporting of AI-related research to improve its scientific vigor.}

This perspective highlights the importance of addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) in patient health outcomes and health inequity, a global problem exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a broad discussion on current developments in digital health and artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), as transformative tools in addressing SDOH factors, offering new capabilities for disease surveillance and patient care. Simultaneously, we bring attention to challenges, such as data standardization, infrastructure limitations, digital literacy, and algorithmic bias, that could hinder equitable access to AI benefits. For LLMs, we highlight potential unique challenges and risks including environmental impact, unfair labor practices, inadvertent disinformation or “hallucinations,” proliferation of bias, and infringement of copyrights. We propose the need for a multitiered approach to digital inclusion as an SDOH and the development of ethical and responsible AI practice frameworks globally and provide suggestions on bridging the gap from development to implementation of equitable AI technologies.}

We performed a systematic search of databases for studies describing NLP applications in thyroid conditions published in English between January 1, 2012 and November 4, 2022. In addition, we used a snowballing technique to identify studies missed in the initial search or published after our search timeline until April 1, 2023. For included studies, we extracted the NLP method (eg, rule-based, machine learning, deep learning, or hybrid), NLP application (eg, identification, classification, and automation), thyroid condition (eg, thyroid cancer, thyroid nodule, and functional or autoimmune disease), data source (eg, electronic health records, health forums, medical literature databases, or genomic databases), performance metrics, and stages of development. We identified 24 eligible NLP studies focusing on thyroid-related conditions. Deep learning-based methods were the most common (38%), followed by rule-based (21%), and traditional machine learning (21%) methods. Thyroid nodules (54%) and thyroid cancer (29%) were the primary conditions under investigation. Electronic health records were the dominant data source (17/24, 71%), with imaging reports being the most frequently used (15/17, 88%). There is increasing interest in NLP applications for thyroid-related studies, mostly addressing thyroid nodules and using deep learning-based methodologies with limited external validation. However, none of the reviewed NLP applications have reached clinical practice. Several limitations, including inconsistent clinical documentation and model portability, need to be addressed to promote the evaluation and implementation of NLP applications to support patient care in thyroidology.}

abstract = {Background:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively.
Methodology:
After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Result and Discussion:
EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders.
Conclusion:
We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification.}

abstract = {Summary: Digitalization in nephrology has progressed in a manner that is disparate and siloed, even though learning (under a broader Learning Health System initiative) has been manifested in all the main areas of clinical application. Most applications based on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) are still in the initial developmental stages and are yet to be adequately validated and shown to contribute to positive patient outcomes. There is also no consistent or comprehensive digitalization plan, and insufficient data are a limiting factor across all of these areas. In this article, we first consider how digitalization along nephrology care pathways relates to the Learning Health System initiative. We then consider the current state of AI/ML-based software and devices in nephrology and the ethical and regulatory challenges in scaling them up toward broader clinical application. We conclude with our proposal to establish a dedicated ethics and governance framework that is centered around health care providers in nephrology and the AI/ML-based software to which their work relates. This framework should help to integrate ethical and regulatory values and considerations, involve a wide range of stakeholders, and apply across normative domains that are conventionally demarcated as clinical, research, and public health.}

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive joint disorder characterized by cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and changes in the subchondral bone, resulting in persistent pain and disability. In recent years, researchers have begun exploring theranostic nanoparticles, tiny systems designed to combine therapy and diagnosis on a single platform, as a new approach to managing OA more personally and precisely. These nanoparticles can deliver drugs, enhance imaging, and target specific tissues directly that require treatment. As a result, they may make therapy both more effective and gentler for patients. In this review, we aim to highlight the achievements made so far and where the field appears to be heading. It covers various types of nanoplatforms, including lipid-based, polymeric, inorganic, and hybrid ones, and explains how they're designed to deliver drugs or aid in imaging within the joint. The review also examines the molecular-level processes in OA, the biomarkers involved, and the reasons scientists are investing significant effort in targeted nanomedicine approaches. Some of the newer methods include local drug delivery systems that release medication slowly where it's needed, regenerative therapies that try to repair tissue, and more innovative materials that can respond to the joint's environment. Despite these advances, there are still issues that require attention, including potential toxicity, immune reactions, and long-term safety concerns. Balancing these risks against the advantages, such as better biocompatibility and targeted action, significant challenge. Laboratory studies have helped identify which cells and molecules are most responsive to these systems; however, translating that success into real clinical results remains a significant hurdle. By comparing the effects of various types of nanoparticles, we can begin to identify the areas where research gaps exist. The goal of this review is to advance the field by exploring how theranostic nanoparticles can be utilised more effectively for personalised OA care. This review summarises current therapeutic advances and limitations in OA theranostics, providing an integrated perspective on existing challenges and potential future directions.}

The objective of this study is to explore how agentic artificial intelligence (AI) can address the limitations of current LLM applications in rheumatology.
Methods
We conducted a viewpoint analysis of the capabilities of agentic AI systems, focusing on their technical foundations, current use cases in healthcare, and relevance to the specific demands of rheumatologic care.
Results
Agentic AI extends LLMs with planning, memory, and the ability to interact with external tools, enabling execution of complex tasks. These capabilities offer promising applications in rheumatology, including personalized treatment planning, automated literature synthesis, and clinical decision support.
Conclusions
Agentic AI systems represent a necessary evolution to meet the complexity of rheumatologic care. Regulatory, ethical and technical challenges must be overcome before agentic systems can be safely deployed in routine rheumatologic care.}

With the introduction of digitization, the computer interpretation of images has been a subject of intense interest, resulting in the introduction of computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) algorithms in the early 2000′s. Although they were introduced with high expectations, the potential improvement in the clinical realm failed to materialize, mostly due to the high number of false positive marks per analyzed image. In the last five years, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in computing, driven mostly by deep learning and convolutional neural networks, has also pervaded the field of automated breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. Research in this area first involved comparison of its capabilities to that of conventional CADe/CADx methods, which quickly demonstrated the potential of this new technology. In the last couple of years, more mature and some commercial products have been developed, and studies of their performance compared to that of experienced breast radiologists are showing that these algorithms are on par with human-performance levels in retrospective data sets. Although additional studies, especially prospective evaluations performed in the real screening environment, are needed, it is becoming clear that AI will have an important role in the future breast cancer screening realm.

abstract = {Background
Sarcopenia, defined as the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer, particularly those with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). Although body composition can be extracted from routine CT imaging, sarcopenia assessment remains underused in clinical practice. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer the potential to automate and standardize this process, but their clinical translation remains limited. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate (1) the clinical impact of CT-defined sarcopenia in BRPC, and (2) the performance and maturity of AI-based methods for automated muscle and fat segmentation on CT images.
Methods
A dual-axis literature search was conducted to identify clinical studies assessing the prognostic role of sarcopenia in BRPC, and technical studies developing AI-based segmentation models for body composition analysis. Structured data extraction was applied to 13 clinical and 71 technical studies. A PRISMA-inspired flow diagram was included to ensure methodological transparency.
Results
Sarcopenia was consistently associated with worse survival and treatment tolerance in BRPC, yet clinical definitions and cut-offs varied widely. AI models—mostly 2D U-Nets trained on L3-level CT slices—achieved high segmentation accuracy (mean DSC >0.93), but external validation and standardization were often lacking.
Conclusion
CT-based AI assessment of sarcopenia holds promise for improving patient stratification in BRPC. However, its clinical adoption will require standardization, integration into decision-support frameworks, and prospective validation across diverse populations.}

In addition, we elaborate on an application case of IST in the early recognition, diagnosis, rehabilitation training, evaluation, and daily care of stroke patients. Finally, we discuss IST's limitations, challenges, and future directions in the medical field. Furthermore, we propose a novel medical voice analysis system architecture that employs active hardware, active software, and human-computer interaction to realize intelligent and evolvable speech recognition.

This systematic review offers an appraisal of the impact of the ATLAS dataset in promoting the development of AI-based segmentation of stroke lesions. An examination of all published studies, that used the ATLAS dataset to both train and test their methods, highlighted an overall moderate performance (median Dice index = 59.40%) and a huge variability across studies in terms of data preprocessing, data augmentation, AI architecture, and the mode of operation (two-dimensional versus three-dimensional methods). Perhaps most importantly, almost all AI tools were borrowed from existing AI architectures in computer vision, as 90% of all selected studies relied on conventional convolutional neural network-based architectures. Overall, current research has not led to the development of robust AI architectures than can handle spatially heterogenous lesion patterns. This review also highlights the difficulty of gauging the performance of AI tools in the presence of uncertainties in the definition of the ground truth.}

The recent COVID-19 pandemic illustrated well the key role of laboratory medicine in the diagnosis, management and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Technological advances improved the laboratory diagnosis and patients’ management and others appear very promising as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) or artificial intelligence (AI). This review describes the current diagnostic assays routinely used in laboratory as well as the novel technologies not in routine yet but that represent future directions and will probably dominate the laboratory in the next years. Serology is important for detecting antibodies and/or antigens of the infectious pathogens or for epidemiological purposes, while real-time PCR with its high sensitivity and specificity has a key role in pathogen detection in different biological matrices and in monitoring the therapy. Nanochip-based technologies make possible delivering a laboratory report at the patient’s bed or in settings where a laboratory-based hospital is not available. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a massively high throughput parallel sequencing technology that allows the simultaneous sequence of billions of DNA fragments in a short time frame. This technology can be used to detect drug-associated mutations, minority species within an infected patient or for pathogen identification. CRISPR-based technology is a fast and accurate diagnostic method that can be applied to different human diseases including infectious diseases. Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in laboratory medicine. In clinical microbiology, it is used to build up diagnosis analyzing genomic information or mass spectra from isolated bacteria, for predicting antibiotic sensitivity or for processing in a short time a large number of images with meaningful results. Thus, the laboratory is becoming increasingly automated and interwoven with sophisticated software or algorithms that will increase the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses, besides reducing time to results.}

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) within medicine, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has gradually reached the forefront of clinical research. In oncology, by mining the underlying connection between a text or image input and the desired output, LLMs demonstrate great potential for managing tumours. In this review, we provide a brief description of the development of LLMs, followed by model construction strategies and general medical functions. We then elaborate on the role of LLMs in cancer screening and diagnosis, metastasis identification, tumour staging, treatment recommendation, and documentation processing tasks by decoding various types of clinical data. Moreover, the current barriers faced by LLMs, such as hallucinations, ethical problems, limited application, and so on, are outlined along with corresponding solutions, where the further purpose is to inspire improvement and innovation in this field with respect to harnessing LLMs for advancing precision oncology.}

abstract = {Background
Oral cancer can show heterogenous patterns of behavior. For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care.
Objectives
This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice.
Data sources
We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC.
Eligibility criteria
Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered.
Data extraction
Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies.
Results
A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations.
Conclusion
Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary.}

The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted.

Tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the biggest health problems in the world. Each year, millions of people get it, and because diagnosis are often delayed, the disease spreads and kills more people. Radiographic examination and sputum smear microscopy are two common ways to find TB, but they aren't very sensitive, need skilled staff, and can't be used on a large scale in places with few resources. Because of this, adding Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has become a promising way to find TB more quickly. This study proposes an NLP-driven framework that leverages structured and unstructured components of EHRs—including clinical notes, diagnostic codes, prescriptions, and laboratory reports—to enhance predictive accuracy. The method uses a preprocessing pipeline that includes removing personal information, normalising the text, and standardising medical terms using ontologies such as UMLS and SNOMED CT to make sure that the terminology is consistent and that privacy rules are followed. We look at a number of different feature extraction methods, such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and advanced embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BioBERT, to find both simple and complex linguistic patterns that can help with TB diagnosis. Transformer-based models and mainly BioBERT have experimental evaluation with the best performance of 95.1 % accuracy and 94.6 % sensitivity. These contextual embedding with a systematized EHR element greatly decreased false negativity, and allowed making early TB risk stratification more credible. The suggested NLP-based framework has a great potential of aiding clinical decision-making in actual healthcare settings.}

abstract = {The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially deep learning methods, has been translated at revolutionary speed to efforts in AI-assisted healthcare. New applications of AI to renal pathology have recently become available, driven by the successful AI deployments in digital pathology. However, synergetic developments of renal pathology and AI require close interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and renal pathologists. Computer scientists should understand that not every AI innovation is translatable to renal pathology, while renal pathologists should capture high-level principles of the relevant AI technologies. Herein, we provide an integrated review on current and possible future applications in AI-assisted renal pathology, by including perspectives from computer scientists and renal pathologists. First, the standard stages, from data collection to analysis, in full-stack AI-assisted renal pathology studies are reviewed. Second, representative renal pathology-optimized AI techniques are introduced. Last, we review current clinical AI applications, as well as promising future applications with the recent advances in AI.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.}

Cost-effectiveness analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine demands consideration of clinical, technical, and economic aspects to generate impactful research of a novel and highly versatile technology.
Objective
We aimed to systematically scope existing literature on the cost-effectiveness of AI and to extract and summarize clinical, technical, and economic dimensions required for a comprehensive assessment.
Methods
A scoping literature review was conducted to map medical, technical, and economic aspects considered in studies on the cost-effectiveness of medical AI. Based on these, a framework for health policy analysis was developed.
Results
Among 4820 eligible studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria for our review. Internal medicine and emergency medicine were the clinical disciplines most frequently analyzed. Most of the studies included were from the United States (5/13, 39%), assessed solutions requiring market access (9/13, 69%), and proposed optimization of direct resources as the most frequent value proposition (7/13, 53%). On the other hand, technical aspects were not uniformly disclosed in the studies we analyzed. A minority of articles explicitly stated the payment mechanism assumed (5/13, 38%), while it remained unspecified in the majority (8/13, 62%) of studies.
Conclusions
Current studies on the cost-effectiveness of AI do not allow to determine if the investigated AI solutions are clinically, technically, and economically viable. Further research and improved reporting on these dimensions seem relevant to recommend and assess potential use cases for this technology.}

abstract = {Context
The incidental detection of localized renal masses has been rising steadily, but a significant proportion of these tumors are benign or indolent and, in most cases, do not require treatment. At the present time, a majority of patients with an incidentally detected renal tumor undergo treatment for the presumption of cancer, leading to a significant number of unnecessary surgical interventions that can result in complications including loss of renal function. Thus, there exists a clinical need for improved tools to aid in the pretreatment characterization of renal tumors to inform patient management.
Objective
To systematically review the evidence on noninvasive, imaging-based tools for solid renal mass characterization.
Evidence acquisition
The MEDLINE database was systematically searched for relevant studies on novel imaging techniques and interpretative tools for the characterization of solid renal masses, published in the past 10 yr.
Evidence synthesis
Over the past decade, several novel imaging tools have offered promise for the improved characterization of indeterminate renal masses. Technologies of particular note include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the kidney, molecular imaging with targeted radiopharmaceutical agents, and use of radiomics as well as artificial intelligence to enhance the interpretation of imaging studies. Among these, 99mTc-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (CT) for the identification of benign renal oncocytomas and hybrid oncocytic chromophobe tumors, and positron emission tomography/CT imaging with radiolabeled girentuximab for the identification of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, are likely to be closest to implementation in clinical practice.
Conclusions
A number of novel imaging tools stand poised to aid in the noninvasive characterization of indeterminate renal masses. In the future, these tools may aid in patient management by providing a comprehensive virtual biopsy, complete with information on tumor histology, underlying molecular abnormalities, and ultimately disease prognosis.
Patient summary
Not all renal tumors require treatment, as a significant proportion are either benign or have limited metastatic potential. Several innovative imaging tools have shown promise for their ability to improve the characterization of renal tumors and provide guidance in terms of patient management.}

Given the high morbidity and mortality in people with psychiatric disorders, coupled with a worsening shortage of mental health care providers, there is an urgent need for AI to help identify high-risk individuals and provide interventions to prevent and treat mental illnesses. While published research on AI in neuropsychiatry is rather limited, there is a growing number of successful examples of AI’s use with electronic health records, brain imaging, sensor-based monitoring systems, and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental illnesses as well as problems such as suicidality. This article is the product of a study group held at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference in 2019. It provides an overview of AI approaches in mental health care, seeking to help with clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, as well as clinical and technological challenges, focusing on multiple illustrative publications. Although AI could help redefine mental illnesses more objectively, identify them at a prodromal stage, personalize treatments, and empower patients in their own care, it must address issues of bias, privacy, transparency, and other ethical concerns. These aspirations reflect human wisdom, which is more strongly associated than intelligence with individual and societal well-being. Thus, the future AI or artificial wisdom could provide technology that enables more compassionate and ethically sound care to diverse groups of people.}

Stem cell-based hydrogel therapies have emerged as a transformative platform, offering enhanced biocompatibility, controlled drug release, and tissue-specific differentiation. However, their clinical translation faces critical barriers, particularly in scaffold integration, cell viability, and long-term functional recovery. To address these challenges, smart monitoring and predictive nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies have been introduced, representing a major shift toward personalized cancer therapy. These tools enable real-time and noninvasive assessment of therapeutic progress using responsive nanomaterials and multimodal imaging techniques. Photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorescence analysis are combined with biosensing to monitor hydrogel degradation, cellular behavior, and microenvironmental changes. Predictive NDE supports early detection of therapeutic failure or relapse by analyzing spatiotemporal data using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This review outlines a closed-loop feedback system that dynamically adapts treatment to improve precision and efficacy while minimizing side effects. Moreover, combining smart materials with stimuli-responsive hydrogels allows on-demand drug delivery in response to tumor-specific cues, such as pH, enzyme concentration, or hypoxia. This multidisciplinary approach shows great promise for overcoming current limitations in oral cancer treatment. It ensures accurate, adaptive, and minimally invasive therapeutic interventions and advances the clinical translation of next-generation oral cancer therapeutics.}

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of generative models (GANs, VAEs, DMs, and LLMs) used to synthesize various medical data types, including imaging (dermoscopic, mammographic, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray), text, time-series, and tabular data (EHR). Unlike previous narrowly focused reviews, our study encompasses a broad array of medical data modalities and explores various generative models. Our aim is to offer insights into their current and future applications in medical research, particularly in the context of synthesis applications, generation techniques, and evaluation methods, as well as providing a GitHub repository as a dynamic resource for ongoing collaboration and innovation. Our search strategy queries databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ArXiv, focusing on recent works from January 2021 to November 2023, excluding reviews and perspectives. This period emphasizes recent advancements beyond GANs, which have been extensively covered in previous reviews. The survey also emphasizes the aspect of conditional generation, which is not focused on in similar work. Key contributions include a broad, multi-modality scope that identifies cross-modality insights and opportunities unavailable in single-modality surveys. While core generative techniques are transferable, we find that synthesis methods often lack sufficient integration of patient-specific context, clinical knowledge, and modality-specific requirements tailored to the unique characteristics of medical data. Conditional models leveraging textual conditioning and multimodal synthesis remain underexplored but offer promising directions for innovation. Our findings are structured around three themes: (1) Synthesis applications, highlighting clinically valid synthesis applications and significant gaps in using synthetic data beyond augmentation, such as for validation and evaluation; (2) Generation techniques, identifying gaps in personalization and cross-modality innovation; and (3) Evaluation methods, revealing the absence of standardized benchmarks, the need for large-scale validation, and the importance of privacy-aware, clinically relevant evaluation frameworks. These findings emphasize the need for benchmarking and comparative studies to promote openness and collaboration.}

As India advances in digital innovation, integrating quantum tools into its oncology framework becomes not only timely but essential in advancing precision oncology tailored to its unique demographic and epidemiological landscape. Quantum computing aids atom-level modeling of biomolecules, multi-omics analytics and personalized therapy design. Quantum sensing and imaging enhance early tumor detection and biomarker analysis, while quantum machine learning (QML) enables population-specific predictive models and adaptive treatment planning. These advancements are particularly relevant to India, where over 1.4 million new cancer cases arise annually, many detected at late stages due to limited diagnostic reach. Quantum technologies offer rapid, noninvasive and cost-effective alternatives that can bridge current healthcare disparities. Enabled through flagship government programs like the National Quantum Mission and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, India, is well-positioned to adopt and implement these transformative technologies. However, future deployment will depend on infrastructure readiness, ethical safeguards and sustained public–private partnerships.

abstract = {Background
In December 2019, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, leading to national and international disruptions in health care, business, education, transportation, and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.
Objective
This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.
Results
We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome–related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.
Conclusions
The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.}

The improved expertise in data capture, the increased capacity for data aggregation and analytic power, along with decreasing costs of genome sequencing and related biologic “omics”, set the foundation and need for novel tools that can meaningfully process these data from multiple sources and of varying types. These advances provide value across biomedical discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention, in a multimodal fashion. However, while big data and AI tools have already revolutionized many fields, medicine has partially lagged due to its complexity and multi-dimensionality, leading to technical challenges in developing and validating solutions that generalize to diverse populations. Indeed, inner biases and miseducation of algorithms, in view of their implementation in daily clinical practice, are increasingly relevant concerns; critically, it is possible for AI to mirror the unconscious biases of the humans who generated these algorithms. Therefore, to avoid worsening existing health disparities, it is critical to employ a thoughtful, transparent, and inclusive approach that involves addressing bias in algorithm design and implementation along the cancer care continuum. In this review, a broad landscape of major applications of AI in cancer care is provided, with a focus on cancer research and precision medicine. Major challenges posed by the implementation of AI in the clinical setting will be discussed. Potentially feasible solutions for mitigating bias are provided, in the light of promoting cancer health equity.}

This breakthrough holds significant promise for critical care medicine, where unstructured data and complex clinical information are abundant. Key applications of LLMs in this field include administrative support through automated documentation and patient chart summarization; clinical decision support by assisting in diagnostics and treatment planning; personalized communication to enhance patient and family understanding; and improving data quality by extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes. Despite these opportunities, challenges such as the risk of generating inaccurate or biased information “hallucinations”, ethical considerations, and the need for clinician artificial intelligence (AI) literacy must be addressed. Integrating LLMs with traditional machine learning models – an approach known as Hybrid AI – combines the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their limitations. Careful implementation, regulatory compliance, and ongoing validation are essential to ensure that LLMs enhance patient care rather than hinder it. LLMs have the potential to transform critical care practices, but integrating them requires caution. Responsible use and thorough clinician training are crucial to fully realize their benefits.}

TB has even surpassed AIDS prior the COVID 19 pandemic. Every year the number of affected persons is increasing exponentially. In 2023 8.2 million new cases of TB were reported. There are various factors responsible for such infectivity rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) including emergence of rapid resistant strains, treatment failure and lack of proper diagnosis. In order to combat the infection, early and effective treatment of the infection is very crucial. This calls for the existence of effective and point of care (POC) diagnostic tool for successful management of the disease. The conventional diagnostics includes staining, microscopy, tuberculin skin test and chest X ray. However, they have various limitations which increases the public threat. These tools lack the ease of transportation, less sensitive, time consuming and lack accuracy. To eliminate such limitations and bridge the gap associated with the proper diagnosis of disease, various biochemical, molecular, immunological diagnostic tools have come up in rescue of the infection. These modern tools are potent enough in characterizing Mtb, detect mutations correlated with the existing medications and ensure effective management. In this article we are focusing on modern diagnostic tools such as T-SPOT, artificial intelligence, electronic nose, RT PCR, TB LAM, CRISPR, biosensor-based detection techniques including the conventional techniques for detection of Mtb in clinical setup in resource limited healthcare facilities for comprehensive diagnosis of tuberculosis.}

Purpose
We review the literature and provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in AI and ML as applied to rhinology. Also, we discuss both the significant benefits of this work as well as the challenges in the implementation and acceptance of these methods for clinical purposes.
Methods
We aimed to identify and explain published studies on the use of AI and ML in rhinology based on PubMed, Scopus, and Google searches. The search string “nasal OR respiratory AND artificial intelligence OR machine learning” was used. Most of the studies covered areas of paranasal sinuses radiology, including allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, computed tomography scans, and nasal cytology.
Results
Cluster analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were mainly used in studies related to rhinology. AI is increasingly affecting healthcare research, and ML technology has been used in studies of chronic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis, providing some exciting new research modalities.
Conclusion
AI is especially useful when there is no conclusive evidence to aid decision making. ML can help doctors make clinical decisions, but it does not entirely replace doctors. However, when critically evaluating studies using this technique, rhinologists must take into account the limitations of its applications and use.}

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed the field of pathology, leading to more standardized and reproducible methods for biomarker quantification. In this study, we examine the application of AI-driven models, particularly deep learning algorithms, to predict PD-L1 expression directly from hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological slides. Several AI-based approaches have been studied, demonstrating high accuracy in estimating PD-L1 expression and predicting responses to ICIs across various cancer types. AI-driven assessments of PD-L1 have been shown to reduce the subjectivity associated with manual scoring methods, such as the Tumor Proportion Score and the Combined Positive Score. Moreover, integrating AI with multimodal data, including genomics, radiomics, and real-world clinical data, can further enhance predictive accuracy and improve patient stratification for immunotherapy. Finally, AI-driven computational pathology offers a transformative approach to biomarker evaluation, providing a faster, more objective, and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods, with significant implications for personalized oncology and precision medicine. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain to be addressed, such as the need for large-scale validation, standardization of AI models, and regulatory approvals for clinical implementation.

Objective
This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize key factors that influence health care workers’ trust in AI-CDSSs and to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing their trust in these systems.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of published studies from January 2020 to November 2024, retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria focused on studies that examined health care workers’ perceptions, experiences, and trust in AI-CDSSs. Studies in non–English languages and those unrelated to health care settings were excluded. Two independent reviewers followed the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Analysis was conducted using a developed data charter. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was applied to assess the quality of the included studies and to evaluate the risk of bias, ensuring a rigorous and systematic review process.
Results
A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving diverse health care workers, predominantly in hospitalized settings. Qualitative methods were the most common (n=16, 59%), with sample sizes ranging from small focus groups to cohorts of over 1000 participants. Eight key themes emerged as pivotal in improving health care workers’ trust in AI-CDSSs: (1) System Transparency, emphasizing the need for clear and interpretable AI; (2) Training and Familiarity, highlighting the importance of knowledge sharing and user education; (3) System Usability, focusing on effective integration into clinical workflows; (4) Clinical Reliability, addressing the consistency and accuracy of system performance; (5) Credibility and Validation, referring to how well the system performs across diverse clinical contexts; (6) Ethical Consideration, examining medicolegal liability, fairness, and adherence to ethical standards;(7) Human Centric Design, pioritizing patient centered approaches; (8) Customization and Control, highlighting the need to tailor tools to specific clinical needs while preserving health care providers’ decision-making autonomy. Barriers to trust included algorithmic opacity, insufficient training, and ethical challenges, while enabling factors for health care workers’ trust in AI-CDSS tools were transparency, usability, and clinical reliability.
Conclusions
The findings highlight the need for explainable AI models, comprehensive training, stakeholder involvement, and human-centered design to foster health care workers’ trust in AI-CDSSs. Although the heterogeneity of study designs and lack of specific data limit further analysis, this review bridges existing gaps by identifying key themes that support trust in AI-CDSSs. It also recommends that future research include diverse demographics, cross-cultural perspectives, and contextual differences in trust across various health care professions.}

Non-invasive imaging enables timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay, risk and expense of surgery. This review updates literature exploring the diagnostic value of specialist endometriosis magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), nuclear medicine (NM) and computed tomography (CT). Searching after the 2016 IDEA consensus, 6192 publications were identified, with 27 studies focused on imaging for endometriosis. eMRI was the subject of 14 papers, NM and CT, 11, and artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing eMRI, 2. eMRI papers describe diagnostic accuracy for endometriosis, methodologies, and innovations. Advantages of eMRI include its: ability to diagnose endometriosis in those unable to tolerate transvaginal endometriosis ultrasound (eTVUS); a panoramic pelvic view, easy translation to surgical fields; identification of hyperintense iron in endometriotic lesions; and ability to identify super-pelvic lesions. Sequence standardization means eMRI is less operator-dependent than eTVUS, but higher costs limit its role to a secondary diagnostic modality. eMRI for deep and ovarian endometriosis has sensitivities of 91-93.5% and specificities of 86-87.5% making it reliable for surgical mapping and diagnosis. Superficial lesions too small for detection in larger capture sequences, means a negative eMRI doesn’t exclude endometriosis. Combined with thin sequence capture and improved reader expertise, eMRI is poised for rapid adoption into clinical practice. NM labeling is diagnostically limited in absence of suitable unique marker for endometrial-like tissue. CT studies expose the reproductively aged to radiation. AI diagnostic tools, combining independent eMRI and eTVUS endometriosis markers, may result in powerful capability. Broader eMRI use, will optimize standards and protocols. Reporting systems correlating to surgical anatomy will facilitate interdisciplinary preoperative dialogues. eMRI endometriosis diagnosis should reduce repeat surgeries with mental and physical health benefits for patients. There is potential for early eMRI diagnoses to prevent chronic pain syndromes and protect fertility outcomes.}

As massive, distributed data streams are generated across edge devices and network layers, there is a growing need for intelligent, privacy-preserving AI solutions that can operate efficiently at the network edge. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without transferring sensitive data, addressing key challenges around privacy, bandwidth, and latency. Despite its benefits in enhancing efficiency, real-time analytics, and regulatory compliance, FL adoption faces challenges, including communication overhead, heterogeneity, security vulnerabilities, and limited edge resources. While recent studies have addressed these issues individually, the literature lacks a unified, cross-domain perspective that reflects the architectural complexity and application diversity of Convergence ICT. This systematic review offers a comprehensive, cross-domain examination of FL within converged ICT infrastructures. The central research question guiding this review is: How can FL be effectively integrated into Convergence ICT environments, and what are the main challenges in implementing FL in such environments, along with possible solutions? We begin with a foundational overview of FL concepts and classifications, followed by a detailed taxonomy of FL architectures, learning strategies, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Through in-depth case studies, we analyse FL’s application across diverse verticals, including smart cities, healthcare, industrial automation, and autonomous systems. We further identify critical challenges—such as system and data heterogeneity, limited edge resources, and security vulnerabilities—and review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, including edge-aware optimization, secure aggregation, and adaptive model updates. In addition, we explore emerging directions in FL research, such as energy-efficient learning, federated reinforcement learning, and integration with blockchain, quantum computing, and self-adaptive networks. This review not only synthesizes current literature but also proposes a forward-looking road map to support scalable, secure, and sustainable FL deployment in future ICT ecosystems.}

By processing multi-omics datasets in integrated formats, we can enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, facilitate biomarker discovery, and develop AI-assisted, personalised therapeutics. Addressing these technical and ethical demands requires robust governance frameworks that protect sensitive data without hindering innovation. This paper underscores a shift toward more secure, transparent, and collaborative biomedical research, marking a decisive step toward clinical transformation.}

Detecting marginal jaw bone loss on radiographs is crucial for diagnosing periodontitis but remains difficult and time-consuming. This review evaluated artificial intelligence (AI) accuracy in identifying the alveolar bone crest and estimating bone loss compared with dental professionals. Moreover, we also assessed whether AI models can detect changes in bone levels over time.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, with diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024517330). Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus up to August 2025. Two independent reviewers screened the articles at the abstract and title levels, and performed full-text and risk-of-bias assessments. A qualitative synthesis was complemented by a random-effects meta-analysis of studies reporting binary classification of marginal bone loss.
Results
Sixty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, with 16 included in the meta-analysis. AI models demonstrated promising performance in detecting the alveolar bone crest and showed high diagnostic accuracy for marginal bone loss, with a pooled sensitivity of 92.3 %, a specificity of 91.7 %, and an AUC of 0.97. However, high heterogeneity and frequent risk of bias were identified. No study evaluated changes in bone levels over time or was performed in a clinical setting.
Conclusion
AI holds promise for facilitating diagnostic decision-making in periodontal care. However, its clinical utility remains limited due to methodological issues. Future research should emphasize external validation, diverse datasets, and longitudinal image analysis to better align AI tools with real-world diagnostic needs.}

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on methods and techniques for identifying and correcting dataset shift in machine learning (ML) applications for health predictions.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, targeting articles published between January 1, 2019, and March 15, 2025. earch strings combined terms related to machine learning, healthcare, and dataset shift. A total of 32 studies were included, and were evaluated based on dataset shift types addressed, detection and correction strategies used, algorithmic choices, and reported impacts on model performance.
Results
The review identified a wide range of dataset shift types, with temporal shift and concept drift being the most commonly addressed. Model-based monitoring and statistical tests were the most frequent detection strategies, while retraining and feature engineering were the predominant correction approaches. Most methods demonstrate moderate interpretability, computational feasibility, and generalizability. However, a lack of standardized performance metrics and external validations limited the comparability of results across studies.
Conclusion
While several promising approaches for managing dataset shift in health-related ML models have been proposed, no single method emerged as broadly generalizable across use cases. The implementation of these techniques in real-world clinical workflows remains limited. Future research should prioritize prospective evaluations, subgroup-specific analyses (e.g., by race, age, or geographic region), and integration into clinical decision-support systems to ensure robust and equitable ML deployment in healthcare settings. A structured summary table and conceptual pipeline diagram are provided to support practical adoption.}

Hence, with its rising incidence, innovative approaches are desirable for its diagnosis and treatment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), characterized by their high specific surface area, tunable pore structure, biocompatibility, and multifunctional modification potential, are not only widely applied across various fields but have also demonstrated unique advantages in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer in recent years. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the use of MOFs for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, as well as advancements in developing increasingly precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). In diagnostics, the review discusses the isolation and detection of pancreatic cancer markers, followed by a focus on MOF-based methods such as MRI, biochemical sensors, and beyond. In terms of therapy, MOF-based treatments for pancreatic cancer are categorized into monotherapies (including acoustic kinetic therapy, photothermal therapy, and chemodynamic therapy), combination therapies, immunotherapies, and other approaches (such as iron-induced apoptosis and drug-delivery systems), highlighting the advancements enabled by MOFs in various treatment modalities. Finally, the integration of AI with MOFs introduces a new paradigm in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. In summary, metal-organic frameworks hold great promise for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially when combined with AI technologies.}

Despite significant advances in probe design, including multifunctional and targeted nanomaterials, their clinical translation remains limited by critical challenges. Key obstacles include nanoprobe stability in physiological environments, nonspecific accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, potential toxicity, and difficulties in achieving optimal biocompatibility and controlled biodistribution. Moreover, the complexity of nanoprobe synthesis and batch-to-batch variability hinder scalable manufacturing and regulatory approval. The primary goal of this review is to critically analyze the current challenges hindering the clinical translation of molecular imaging nanoprobes in biomedicine. While existing literature extensively covers imaging techniques, this review uniquely emphasizes the persistent obstacles—such as nanoprobe stability, biocompatibility, off-target effects, and limited sensitivity—that impede their effective application. Unlike previous reviews, which tend to focus broadly on advancements, we offer a nuanced perspective by identifying specific barriers and proposing promising strategies to overcome them. We explore how surface modification, novel targeting ligands, and smart responsive systems can enhance nanoprobe performance. Furthermore, the review discusses how addressing these challenges is crucial for accelerating the development of multifunctional nanoprobes capable of simultaneous diagnosis and therapy, ultimately advancing personalized medicine.

HCC incidences are rapidly soaring due to challenges in early detection and resistance to conventional treatments and their associated side effects.

This makes the advent of precision medicine all the more crucial in improving the medical care of HCC patients. This paper explores three prominent aspects of precision medicine in detail. These include omics, translational research, i.e., preclinical and clinical studies, and artificial intelligence (AI). Omics studies enable the analysis of various biological molecules to identify genetic alterations, protein expression patterns, and metabolic changes associated with HCC. They allow for the discovery of prospective biomarkers and the elucidation of underlying cancer biology mechanisms validated in preclinical studies, including animal models and cell culture experiments, before clinical assessment. AI can revolutionize HCC management by integrating and analyzing vast amounts of data from omics, preclinical, and clinical research. AI-powered tools provide a multitude of applications to improve patient outcomes. Together, these facets culminate in a comprehensive precision medicine approach that can be implemented to transform the landscape of HCC.}

This study delves into applying NLP technologies within the healthcare sector, drawing insights from textual datasets from various sources. It reviews the relevant articles from 2019 to 2023 and compares the pertinent solutions included therein. In addition, it explores the various NLP technologies used for processing healthcare datasets in multiple languages. The review focuses on existing studies related to various medical conditions, including cancer and chronic and infectious diseases. It categorizes these cutting-edge studies into four different NLP task categories: prediction and detection, text analysis and modeling, information processing, and other healthcare applications. Notably, the findings reveal that the most prevalent NLP tasks employed in healthcare revolve around risk prediction and text classification. Moreover, the study identifies a pressing need for more extensive research that encompasses the utilization of non-textual medical datasets from EHR, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A key observation is that much of the current research studies about NLP related to the healthcare field were primarily using conventional data processing methods, such as ML and DL techniques. Despite their success, these methods frequently have several distinct limitations as they are not able to handle large-scale, complex datasets. In contrast, there is less focus on sophisticated technologies such as big data analytics and transformer-based modeling. Big data analytics can manage massive amounts of unstructured data from sources such as EHRs and social media, providing a more comprehensive insight into healthcare patterns. Transformer models, like BERT and GPT, are designed to detect complex patterns and contextual relationships in text, making them particularly useful for medical text classification, sentiment analysis, and disease prediction. Current research studies have not fully explored the potential of these advanced technologies, which could significantly increase the efficiency and scalability of natural language processing applications in healthcare. This highlights opportunities for further exploration and innovation within the domain of NLP in healthcare.}

This study reviews the existing studies on classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in metastatic cancer research. Since the majority of metastatic cancer research data are collected in the formats of PET/CT and MRI image data, deep learning techniques are heavily involved. However, its black-box nature and expensive computational cost are notable concerns. Furthermore, existing models could be overestimated for their generality due to the non-diverse population in clinical trial datasets.

abstract = {Purpose
Accurate clinical diagnosis of lymph node metastases is of paramount importance in the treatment of patients with abdominopelvic malignancy. This review assesses the diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithms and radiomics models for lymph node metastases in abdominopelvic malignancies.
Methodology
Embase (PubMed, MEDLINE), Science Direct and IEEE Xplore databases were searched to identify eligible studies published between January 2009 and March 2019. Studies that reported on the accuracy of deep learning algorithms or radiomics models for abdominopelvic malignancy by CT or MRI were selected. Study characteristics and diagnostic measures were extracted. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Evaluation of risk of bias was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool.
Results
In total, 498 potentially eligible studies were identified, of which 21 were included and 17 offered enough information for a quantitative analysis. Studies were heterogeneous and substantial risk of bias was found in 18 studies. Almost all studies employed radiomics models (n = 20). The single published deep-learning model out-performed radiomics models with a higher AUROC (0.912 vs 0.895), but both radiomics and deep-learning models outperformed the radiologist’s interpretation in isolation (0.774). Pooled results for radiomics nomograms amongst tumour subtypes demonstrated the highest AUC 0.895 (95 %CI, 0.810−0.980) for urological malignancy, and the lowest AUC 0.798 (95 %CI, 0.744−0.852) for colorectal malignancy.
Conclusion
Radiomics models improve the diagnostic accuracy of lymph node staging for abdominopelvic malignancies in comparison with radiologist’s assessment. Deep learning models may further improve on this, but data remain limited.}

In younger populations, Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphomas predominate, while older populations more commonly experience subtypes such as diffuse large B-cell, follicular, marginal zone, and mantle cell lymphomas. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the gold standard for staging, treatment response assessment, and prognostication in lymphoma. However, interpretation of PET/CT is complex, time-consuming, and reliant on expert imaging specialists, exacerbating challenges associated with workforce shortages worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential across multiple aspects of PET/CT imaging in this setting. AI applications in appointment planning have demonstrated utility in reducing nonattendance rates and improving departmental efficiency. Advanced reconstruction techniques leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable reduced injected activities of radiopharmaceutical and patient dose whilst maintaining diagnostic accuracy, particularly benefiting younger patients requiring multiple scans. Automated segmentation tools, predominantly using 3D U-Net architectures, have improved quantification of metrics such as total metabolic tumour volume (TMTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), facilitating prognostication and treatment stratification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including variability in segmentation performance, impact on Deauville Score interpretation, and standardization of TMTV/TLG measurements. Emerging large language models (LLMs) also show promise in enhancing PET/CT reporting, converting free-text reports into structured formats, and improving patient communication. Further research is required to address limitations such as AI-induced errors, physiological uptake differentiation, and the integration of AI models into clinical workflows. With robust validation and harmonization, AI integration could significantly enhance lymphoma care, improving diagnostic precision, workflow efficiency, and patient outcomes.}

Investigate the literature available in the use of DL technology to support dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. We summarize the literature that uses DL features to analyze datasets for the purpose of a quick COVID-19 detection.
Methods
This review follows PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We have scanned the most two commonly used databases (IEEE, ACM). Search terms were identified based on the target intervention (DL) and the target population (COVID-19). Two authors independently handled study selection and one author assigned for data extraction. A narrative approach is used to synthesize the extracted data.
Results
We retrieved 53 studies and after passing through PRISMA excluding criteria, only 17 studies are considered in this review. All studies used deep learning for detection of COVID-19 cases in early stage based on different diagnostic modalities. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning (TL) were the most commonly used techniques.
Conclusion
The included studies showed that DL techniques has significant impact on early detection of COVID-19 with high accuracy rate. However, most of the proposed methods are still in development and not tested in a clinical setting. Further investigation and collaboration are required from the research community and healthcare professionals in order to develop and standardize guidelines for use of DL in the healthcare domain.}

abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) and big data analytics are rapidly transforming health care, particularly disease prediction, management, and personalized care. With the increasing availability of real-world data (RWD) from diverse sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), patient registries, and wearable devices, ML techniques present substantial potential to enhance clinical outcomes. Despite this promise, challenges such as data quality, model transparency, generalizability, and integration into clinical practice persist.
Objective
This systematic review aims to examine the use of ML for analyzing RWD in disease prediction and management, identifying the most commonly used ML methods, prevalent disease types, study designs, and the sources of real-world evidence (RWE). It also explores the strengths and limitations of current practices, offering insights for future improvements.
Methods
A comprehensive search was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to identify studies using ML techniques for analyzing RWD in disease prediction and management. The search focused on extracting data regarding the ML algorithms applied; disease categories studied; types of study designs (eg, clinical trials and cohort studies); and the sources of RWE, including EHRs, patient registries, and wearable devices. Studies published between 2014 and 2024 were included to ensure the analysis of the most recent advances in the field.
Results
This review identified 57 studies that met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample size of >150,000 patients. The most frequently applied ML methods were random forest (n=24, 42%), logistic regression (n=21, 37%), and support vector machines (n=18, 32%). These methods were predominantly used for predictive modeling across disease areas, including cardiovascular diseases (n=19, 33%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and neurological disorders (n=6, 11%). RWE was primarily sourced from EHRs, patient registries, and wearable devices. A substantial portion of studies (n=38, 67%) focused on improving clinical decision-making, patient stratification, and treatment optimization. Among these studies, 14 (25%) focused on decision-making; 12 (21%) on health care outcomes, such as quality of life, recovery rates, and adverse events; and 11 (19%) on survival prediction, particularly in oncology and chronic diseases. For example, random forest models for cardiovascular disease prediction demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.89), while support vector machine models for cancer prognosis achieved an accuracy of 83% (P=.04). Despite the promising outcomes, many (n=34, 60%) studies faced challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and ensuring generalizability across diverse patient populations.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlights the significant potential of ML and big data analytics in health care, especially for improving disease prediction and management. However, to fully realize the benefits of these technologies, future research must focus on addressing the challenges of data quality, enhancing model transparency, and ensuring the broader applicability of ML models across diverse populations and clinical settings.}

However, with the advent in applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, researchers have turned their focus towards designing of efficient intelligent computer aided detection and diagnosis systems for prognosis of this catastrophic disease using image processing and computer vision (CV) techniques. An abundance of work could be found in literature on classification of different breast abnormalities, where majority of them has dealt with binary classification (i.e. benign and malignant). In current study, a comprehensive review has been presented to analyze and evaluate state of the art proposed methodologies for breast cancer diagnosis based over commonly used breast screening imaging modalities. The studies under consideration are mainly categorized into statistical machine learning based and deep learning based classifier, where deep classifiers further sub-categorized into models built from scratch and transfer learning based models.

While an obvious application is the analysis of histological images, recent applications for the analysis of molecular profiling data from different sources and clinical data support the notion that AI will enhance both histopathology and molecular pathology in the future. At the same time, current literature should not be misunderstood in a way that pathologists will likely be replaced by AI applications in the foreseeable future.

abstract = {The growth of artificial intelligence in promoting healthcare is rapidly progressing. Notwithstanding its promising nature, however, AI in healthcare embodies certain ethical challenges as well. This research aims to delineate the most influential elements of scientific research on AI ethics in healthcare by conducting bibliometric, social network analysis, and cluster-based content analysis of scientific articles. Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare. Practically, this research will provide a map for policymakers and AI engineers and scientists on what dimensions of AI-based medical interventions require stricter policies and guidelines and robust ethical design and development.}

Furthermore, due to different confounding morbidities and the uniqueness of the ICU setting, it is difficult to protocolize treatment regimens in the ICU. In highly complex ICU setting where man and resource management becomes extremely challenging, definite advancements are required to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) for prognosticating the course of the disease to aid in informed decision-making. AI is the intelligence of a computer or computer-supervised robot to execute a piece of work commonly associated with intelligent beings, wherein the machines go beyond the realms of normal information processing by adding the characteristics of learning, sound reasoning, and weighting of the inputs. AI recognizes circuitous, relational time-series blueprint within datasets and this reasoning of analysis transcends conventional threshold-based analysis adapted in ICU protocols. AI works on the principle of a more complex form of Machine Learning by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These information-processing paradigms use multidimensional arrays called tensors which aid in ‘learning’ and ‘weighting’ all the information made available to it, thereby converting normal machine learning into Deep Learning. Here, the use of AI for data mining in complex ICU settings for protocol formulation and temporal representation and reasoning is discussed.}

Machine learning (ML) is an approach to AI in which machines can “learn” to perform tasks in an automated process, rather than being explicitly programmed by a human. Research aiming to apply ML techniques to classification, prediction and decision-making problems in healthcare has increased 61-fold from 2005 to 2019, mirroring this sense of early promise. The field of healthcare ML is relatively young, and many critical steps are needed before adoption into clinical practice, including transparent, unbiased development and reporting of algorithms. Articles claiming that machines can outperform, or replace, doctors in high-level tasks, such as diagnosis or prognostication, must be carefully appraised. It is critical that surgeons have an understanding of the principles and terminology of AI and ML to evaluate these claims and to take an active role in directing research.

This review synthesizes current advancements in in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques for imaging BBB breakdown in AD. The BBB, a dynamic neurovascular interface, regulates amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau clearance through specialized transporters and cellular interactions. BBB dysfunction, driven by tight junction disruption, transporter deficits, and pericyte degeneration, exacerbates Aβaccumulation and neuroinflammation. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI quantifies subtle leakage via gadolinium kinetics, while water-exchange MRI probes trans-BBB water dynamics without contrast agents. Dynamic glucose-enhanced MRI maps glucose transport anomalies linked to glucose transporter- 1 dysfunction. PET imaging with tracers like [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and [11C]-verapamil evaluates glucose metabolism and efflux transporter activity, revealing early metabolic deficits and impaired Aβ clearance. Challenges include low sensitivity for subtle leakage, model-dependent quantification, and spatial-temporal resolution trade-offs. Emerging strategies emphasize multimodal integration, ultrahigh-field systems, and artificial intelligence-driven analytics to decode region-specific BBB pathology. Longitudinal studies correlating imaging biomarkers with clinical progression and novel PET tracer development are pivotal for early diagnosis and personalized therapies. These innovations promise to elucidate BBB’s role and promote a paradigm shift in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies from solely targeting amyloid proteins to multi-target interventions in AD.}

abstract = {Background
As the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies increases in the healthcare sector, the industry faces a need to combine medical knowledge, often expressed as clinical rules, with advances in machine learning (ML), which offer high prediction accuracy at the expense of transparency of decision making.
Purpose
This paper seeks to review the present literature, identify hybrid architecture patterns that incorporate rules and machine learning, and evaluate the rationale behind their selection to inform future development and research on the design of transparent and precise clinical decision systems.
Methods
PubMed, IEEE Explore, and Google Scholar were queried in search for papers from 1992 to 2022, with the keywords: “clinical decision system”, “hybrid clinical architecture”, “machine learning and clinical rules”. Excluded articles did not use both ML and rules or did not provide any explanation of employed architecture. A proposed taxonomy was used to organize the results, analyze them, and depict them in graphical and tabular form. Two researchers, one with expertise in rule-based systems and another in ML, reviewed identified papers and discussed the work to minimize bias, and the third one re-reviewed the work to ensure consistency of reporting.
Results
The authors screened 957 papers and reviewed 71 that met their criteria. Five distinct architecture archetypes were determined: Rules are Embedded in ML architecture (REML) (most used), ML pre-processes input data for Rule-Based inference (MLRB), Rule-Based method pre-processes input data for ML prediction (RBML), Rules influence ML training (RMLT), Parallel Ensemble of Rules and ML (PERML), which was rarely observed in clinical contexts.
Conclusions
Most architectures in the reviewed literature prioritize prediction accuracy over explainability and trustworthiness, which has led to more complex embedded approaches. Alternatively, parallel (PERML) architectures may be employed, allowing for a more transparent system that is easier to explain to patients and clinicians. The potential of this approach warrants further research.
Other
A limitation of the study may be that it reviews scientific literature, while algorithms implemented in clinical practice may present different distributions of motivations and implementations of hybrid architectures.}

Early detection and prompt treatment offer the best outcomes to patients, yet the majority of OC lesions are detected at late stages with 45% survival rate for 2 years. The primary cause of poor OC outcomes is unavailable or ineffective screening and surveillance at the local point-of-care level, leading to delays in specialist referral and subsequent treatment. Lack of adequate awareness of OC among the public and professionals, and barriers to accessing health care services in a timely manner also contribute to delayed diagnosis. As image analysis and diagnostic technologies are evolving, various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, specific algorithms and predictive models are beginning to have a considerable impact in improving diagnostic accuracy for OC. AI based technologies combined with intraoral photographic images or optical imaging methods are under investigation for automated detection and classification of OC. These new methods and technologies have great potential to improve outcomes, especially in low-resource settings. Such approaches can be used to predict oral cancer risk as an adjunct to population screening by providing real-time risk assessment. The objective of this study is to (1) provide an overview of components of delayed OC diagnosis and (2) evaluate novel AI based approaches with respect to their utility and implications for improving oral cancer detection.}

Consequently, Transformer-based models have garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. This is due to their tremendous potential and impressive accomplishments, which extend beyond Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to encompass various domains, including Computer Vision (CV), audio and speech processing, healthcare, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although several survey papers have been published, spotlighting the Transformer’s contributions in specific fields, architectural disparities, or performance assessments, there remains a notable absence of a comprehensive survey paper that encompasses its major applications across diverse domains. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap by conducting an extensive survey of proposed Transformer models spanning from 2017 to 2022. Our survey encompasses the identification of the top five application domains for Transformer-based models, namely: NLP, CV, multi-modality, audio and speech processing, and signal processing. We analyze the influence of highly impactful Transformer-based models within these domains and subsequently categorize them according to their respective tasks, employing a novel taxonomy.

abstract = {With the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) empowered applications for critical applications like healthcare, the questions about liability, trust, and interpretability of their outputs are raising. The black-box nature of various DL models is a roadblock to clinical utilization. Therefore, to gain the trust of clinicians and patients, we need to provide explanations about the decisions of models. With the promise of enhancing the trust and transparency of black-box models, researchers are in the phase of maturing the field of eXplainable ML (XML). In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of explainable and interpretable ML techniques for various healthcare applications. Along with highlighting security, safety, and robustness challenges that hinder the trustworthiness of ML, we also discussed the ethical issues arising because of the use of ML/DL for healthcare. We also describe how explainable and trustworthy ML can resolve all these ethical problems. Finally, we elaborate on the limitations of existing approaches and highlight various open research problems that require further development.}

This review comprehensively examines the mechanistic basis, clinical applications, and current challenges of chemo-immunotherapy, with a particular emphasis on the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in optimizing such combinations. We discuss how chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD), antigen release, and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) potentiate ICI efficacy. Furthermore, we explore how AI-driven approaches, including multi-omics integration, radiomics, and deep learning facilitate the identification of synergistic drug pairs, prediction of treatment responses, and stratification of patients. Despite promising clinical outcomes across various malignancies, key challenges such as chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, tumor heterogeneity, and data interpretability remain. Ultimately, the convergence of AI with immuno-oncology holds great promise for advancing personalized cancer therapy through improved biomarker discovery, rational combination design, and dynamic treatment adaptation.}

Cardiovascular medicine is particularly well poised to take advantage of these ML advances, due to the widespread digitization of medical data and the large number of diagnostic tests used to evaluate cardiovascular disease. Various ML approaches have successfully been applied to cardiovascular tests and diseases to automate interpretation, accurately perform measurements, and, in some cases, predict novel diagnoses from less invasive tests, effectively expanding the utility of more widely accessible diagnostic tests. Here, we present examples of some impactful advances in cardiovascular medicine using ML across a variety of modalities, with a focus on deep learning applications.}

Chatbot is a timely topic applied in various fields, including medicine and health care, for human-like knowledge transfer and communication. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been proven particularly applicable in health care, with the ability for complex dialog management and conversational flexibility.
Objective
This review article aims to report on the recent advances and current trends in chatbot technology in medicine. A brief historical overview, along with the developmental progress and design characteristics, is first introduced. The focus will be on cancer therapy, with in-depth discussions and examples of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, patient support, workflow efficiency, and health promotion. In addition, this paper will explore the limitations and areas of concern, highlighting ethical, moral, security, technical, and regulatory standards and evaluation issues to explain the hesitancy in implementation.
Methods
A search of the literature published in the past 20 years was conducted using the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases. The screening of chatbots was guided by the open-access Botlist directory for health care components and further divided according to the following criteria: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, support, workflow, and health promotion.
Results
Even after addressing these issues and establishing the safety or efficacy of chatbots, human elements in health care will not be replaceable. Therefore, chatbots have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice by working alongside health practitioners to reduce costs, refine workflow efficiencies, and improve patient outcomes. Other applications in pandemic support, global health, and education are yet to be fully explored.
Conclusions
Further research and interdisciplinary collaboration could advance this technology to dramatically improve the quality of care for patients, rebalance the workload for clinicians, and revolutionize the practice of medicine.}

Low back pain (LBP) remains the leading cause of disability globally. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potentially useful tool to aid the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of LBP.
PURPOSE
In this review, we assess the scope of ML applications in the LBP literature and outline gaps and opportunities.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING
A scoping review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.
METHODS
Articles were extracted from the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. Title/abstract and full-text screening was performed by two reviewers. Data on model type, model inputs, predicted outcomes, and ML methods were collected.
RESULTS
In total, 223 unique studies published between 1988 and 2023 were identified, with just over 50% focused on low-back-pain detection. Neural networks were used in 106 of these articles. Common inputs included patient history, demographics, and lab values (67% total). Articles published after 2010 were also likely to incorporate imaging data into their models (41.7% of articles). Of the 212 supervised learning articles identified, 168 (79.4%) mentioned use of a training or testing dataset, 116 (54.7%) utilized cross-validation, and 46 (21.7%) implemented hyperparameter optimization. Of all articles, only 8 included external validation and 9 had publicly available code.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the rapid application of ML in LBP research, a majority of articles do not follow standard ML best practices. Furthermore, over 95% of articles cannot be reproduced or authenticated due to lack of code availability. Increased collaboration and code sharing are needed to support future growth and implementation of ML in the care of patients with LBP.}

This article reviews recent advances in computer-aided segmentation methods for oral and maxillofacial surgery and describes the advantages and limitations of these methods. The objective is to provide an invaluable resource for precise therapy and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Study selection, data and sources: This review includes full-text articles and conference proceedings reporting the application of segmentation methods in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The research focuses on three aspects: tooth detection segmentation, mandibular canal segmentation and alveolar bone segmentation. The most commonly used imaging technique is CBCT, followed by conventional CT and Orthopantomography. A systematic electronic database search was performed up to July 2023 (Medline via PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ArXiv, Google Scholar were searched).
Results
These segmentation methods can be mainly divided into two categories: traditional image processing and machine learning (including deep learning). Performance testing on a dataset of images labeled by medical professionals shows that it performs similarly to dentists' annotations, confirming its effectiveness. However, no studies have evaluated its practical application value.
Conclusion
Segmentation methods (particularly deep learning methods) have demonstrated unprecedented performance, while inherent challenges remain, including the scarcity and inconsistency of datasets, visible artifacts in images, unbalanced data distribution, and the “black box” nature.
Clinical significance
Accurate image segmentation is critical for precise treatment and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This review aims to facilitate more accurate and effective surgical treatment planning among dental researchers.}

The Medical Physicists (MPs) are traditionally responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of technology implementation in diagnostic and therapeutic settings. As such, they are also expected to contribute to the introduction of AI medical devices in routine clinical practice. Specifically, the MPs will play a stakeholder role for AI tools procurement, acceptance testing, commissioning, and quality assurance to confirm the claimed performances in relation to the medical device's intended use. Moreover, MPs who act as co-creators of such AI tools, will play a pivotal role in product requirements definition, data collection and annotation, clinical evaluation, support for regulatory pathways and marketing through scientific congresses and scientific publications. As AI software differs from the traditional (hardware) medical device that the MP is used to introduce in clinical settings, there is a need to acquire new competencies in the field of AI and its regulatory aspects. The purpose of this paper is to provide MPs with practical guidelines on regulatory aspects of AI medical devices, in the European and in the US landscape.}

COVID-19 has been designated an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has placed a tremendous burden on nearly all countries, especially those with weak health systems. However, Deep Learning (DL) has been applied in several applications and many types of detection applications in the medical field, including thyroid diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, fetal localization, and detection of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, various clinical imaging sources, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT), make DL a perfect technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19. Inspired by this fact, a considerable amount of research has been done. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been used in this study to discover, assess, and integrate findings from relevant studies. DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and hybrid approaches. Then, the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted. Moreover, many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for COVID-19 have been addressed, which are anticipated to stimulate more investigations to control the prevalence and disaster control in the future. According to the findings, most papers are assessed using characteristics such as accuracy, delay, robustness, and scalability. Meanwhile, other features are underutilized, such as security and convergence time. Python is also the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 75% of the time. According to the investigation, 37.83% of applications have identified chest CT/chest X-ray images for patients.}

Unlike X-rays, which use ionizing radiation, ultrasound imaging utilizes non-hazardous acoustic waves and is widely preferred by doctors. However, ultrasound imaging sometimes requires substantial manual effort in the identification of organs during real-time scanning. Also, it is a challenging task if the scanning performed by an unskilled clinician does not comprise adequate information about the organ, leading to an incorrect diagnosis and thereby fatal consequences. Hence, the automated organ classification in such scenarios can offer potential benefits. In this paper, We propose a convolutional neural network-based architecture (CNNs), precisely, a transfer learning approach using ResNet, VGG, GoogleNet, and Inception models for accurate classification of abdominal organs namely kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and urinary bladder. The performance of the proposed framework is analyzed using in-house developed dataset comprising of 1906 ultrasound images. Performance analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy and F1 score of 98.77% and 98.55%, respectively, on an average. Also, we provide the performance of the proposed architecture in comparison with the state-of-the-art studies.}

Adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery involves high costs and risks, with Proximal Junctional Kyphosis (PJK) and Proximal Junctional Failure (PJF) being major concerns. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer potential in predicting and preventing these complications. This review examines the role of AI in predicting PJK/PJF, its effectiveness, and future research needs.
Research question
Can AI-based models accurately predict PJK/PJF after ASD surgery, and what factors affect their performance?
Material and methods
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to December 2024. Keywords included “Adult Spinal Deformity,” “PJK,” “PJF,” “AI,” and “ML.” Data extracted included study characteristics, patient demographics, surgical details, AI model parameters, and performance metrics. Bias risk was assessed using the MINORS score.
Results
Among 164 studies, 7 met inclusion criteria (n = 2179 patients). Mean age was 63.2 ± 3.7 years, BMI 26.1 ± 2.4 kg/m2, and fusion levels 9.82 ± 1.8. PJK/PJF occurred in 41.1 %. AI models (Random Forest, supervised learning) had accuracy from 72.5 % to 100 % (AUC up to 1.0). Key predictors included age, BMD, spinal alignment, and implant type.
Discussion and conclusions
AI and ML models show promise in predicting PJK/PJF after ASD surgery. However, larger multicenter studies with standardized definitions, BMD assessments, and preoperative MRI integration are needed for broader clinical application and validation.}

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and discern patterns without direct instruction. This review explores cutting-edge developments in microsurgery through the lens of AI applications. By analyzing a wide range of studies, this paper highlights AI’s transformative role in enhancing microsurgical techniques and decision-making processes. A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed (2005–2023). Extensive data on ML model function and composition, as well as broader study characteristics, were collected from each study. Study quality was assessed across 7 methodological areas of AI research using an adapted methodological index of nonrandomized studies (MINORS) tool. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. ML was used primarily for prognosis (35%), postoperative assessment (29%), and intraoperative assistance/robotic surgery (24%). Only 2 studies were conducted beyond phase 0 of AI research. Fourteen studies included a training group, but only one of these reported both validation and training sets. ML model performance was assessed most frequently using accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Scores for the adapted MINORS criteria ranged from 10 to 14 out of 14, with a median of 12. Through collation of all available preclinical and clinical trials, this review suggests the efficacy of ML for various microsurgical applications. Despite this, widespread adoption of this technology remains scarce, currently limited by methodological flaws of individual studies and structural barriers to disruptive technologies. However, with growing evidence supporting its use, microsurgeons should be receptive to implementing ML-incorporated technologies or may risk falling behind other specialties.}

abstract = {Background
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially generative AI, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical field. Through massive medical data training, it can understand complex medical texts and can quickly analyze medical records and provide health counseling and diagnostic advice directly, especially in rare diseases. However, no study has yet compared and extensively discussed the diagnostic performance of LLMs with that of physicians.
Objective
This study systematically reviewed the accuracy of LLMs in clinical diagnosis and provided reference for further clinical application.
Methods
We conducted searches in CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP Database, SinoMed, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) from January 1, 2017, to the present. A total of 2 reviewers independently screened the literature and extracted relevant information. The risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), which evaluates both the risk of bias and the applicability of included studies.
Results
A total of 30 studies involving 19 LLMs and a total of 4762 cases were included. The quality assessment indicated a high risk of bias in the majority of studies, primary cause is known case diagnosis. For the optimal model, the accuracy of the primary diagnosis ranged from 25% to 97.8%, while the triage accuracy ranged from 66.5% to 98%.
Conclusions
LLMs have demonstrated considerable diagnostic capabilities and significant potential for application across various clinical cases. Although their accuracy still falls short of that of clinical professionals, if used cautiously, they have the potential to become one of the best intelligent assistants in the field of human health care.}

In this study, we address these challenges through the development of a cost-sensitive logistic regression framework that is explicitly tailored to better represent the highly uneven penalties associated with missing TB detection cases in screening scale clinical settings. By using a large chest X-ray dataset, our approach cascades cost-awareness from the training phase to the evaluation phase and learns clinically relevant trade-offs between costs due to false negatives (FNs) and FPs - simultaneously optimizing for multiple metrics including sensitivity, specificity. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method yields a significant improvement in detection sensitivity across risk and cost regimes (by approximately 60 %) at the same level of interpretability and operational scalability required for use in resource-limited or high-burden settings. We believe that these insights can help stakeholders develop more effective and equitable TB case finding in practice, particularly with adaptive risk-cost calibration for AI-driven TB screening tools.}

Conventional diagnostic tools, such as the “ABCDE” criteria and dermoscopy, frequently fail to detect AM in early stages, leading to delayed diagnoses and advanced disease. Advanced imaging techniques like reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have improved detection accuracy, but underdiagnosis remains a significant challenge. Recent molecular insights, including TERT promoter mutations and BRAF/KIT alterations, have refined risk stratification and guided personalized treatments. However, immunoresistance and diagnostic complexity continue to hinder outcomes in advanced cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential by addressing these gaps through its ability to analyze subtle vascular and morphological patterns often missed by clinicians. When integrated with molecular diagnostics, AI enables earlier detection, precise staging, and tailored therapeutic strategies. For instance, AI-powered tools can incorporate genetic and imaging data to predict treatment responses and optimize patient selection. Emerging approaches, such as SPION-functionalized CAR-T cells, liquid biopsies, and multimodal AI tools, promise further advancements in diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy. This review highlights the importance of combining AI with molecular diagnostics to achieve more precise, personalized, and equitable care for AM. Collaborative efforts among dermatologists and oncologists, and data scientists are essential to translate these innovations into practice and address disparities in outcomes for this challenging melanoma subtype.}

abstract = {Introduction
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performs a critical role in breast cancer diagnosis, especially for high-risk populations e.g. family history. MRI could take advantage of the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). AI assessment of breast composition factors is less studied than those of lesion detection and classification. These factors are breast density, background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) and fibroglandular tissue (FGT), which are recognized breast cancer phenotypes.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, the PROSPERO registered review examined the role of AI in assessing breast composition in MRI. A search of articles from Pubmed, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google scholar from 2010 to 2022 was conducted. Peer-reviewed, in-vivo studies were included based on defined search categories. Adapted QUADAS-2, CASP and Covidence tools were utilized for quality assessment.
Results
Seven studies were identified as being of sufficiently high quality. The studies showed that AI has the potential to provide a comparable level of accuracy against the relevant reference standard. There were limited performance results when delineating BPE and FGT BI-RADs categories. The review highlighted the variability in AI models while the range of statistical methods and small cohort sizes limited cross study compatibility.
Conclusions
AI has potential in assessing breast composition in MRI. However, variability in AI systems deployed and statistical measurements alongside limited validation across diverse populations remain an issue. AI systems may perform better with binary categorizations rather than the quaternary spectrum of BI-RADS.
Implications for practice
AI could assist in developing personalized breast composition assessments. Future developments could focus on better delineation of breast composition categories. AI models that have trained on more diverse and larger populations should result in more robust and effective clinical applications.}

The use of AI to improve and extract more information out of medical images, given their parallels with natural images and the immense progress in the area of computer vision, has been at the forefront of these advances.

In this article, we review the progress in the use of AI toward optimizing PET/CT and PET/MRI studies. These two methods, which combine molecular information with structural and (in the case of MRI) functional imaging, are extremely valuable for a wide range of clinical indications. They are also tremendously data-rich modalities and as such are highly amenable to data-driven technologies such as AI. The first half of the article will focus on methods to improve PET reconstruction and image quality, which has multiple benefits including faster image acquisition, image reconstruction, and lower or even “zero” radiation dose imaging. It will also address the value of AI-driven methods to perform MR-based attenuation correction. The second half will address how some of these advances can be used to perform to optimize diagnosis from the acquired images, with examples given for whole-body oncology, cardiology, and neurology indications. Overall, it is likely that the use of AI will markedly improve both the quality and safety of PET/CT and PET/MRI as well as enhance our ability to interpret the scans and follow lesions over time. This will hopefully lead to expanded clinical use cases for these valuable technologies leading to better patient care.}

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal type of cancer with most of the cases being diagnosed in an advanced stage and poor prognosis. Developing new diagnostic and prognostic markers for pancreatic cancer can significantly improve early detection and patient outcomes. These biomarkers can potentially revolutionize medical practice by enabling personalized, more effective, targeted treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
Methods
The search strategy was developed following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science, covering all English publications up to September 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was utilized to assess bias, categorizing studies as "good," "fair," or "poor" quality based on their NOS scores. Descriptive statistics for all included studies were compiled and reviewed, along with the NOS scores for each study to indicate their quality assessment.
Results
Our results showed that SVM and RF are the most widely used algorithms in machine learning and data analysis, particularly for biomarker identification. SVM, a supervised learning algorithm, is employed for both classification and regression by mapping data points in high-dimensional space to identify the optimal separating hyperplane between classes.
Conclusions
The application of machine-learning algorithms in the search for novel biomarkers in pancreatic cancer represents a significant advancement in the field. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, researchers are poised to make strides towards earlier detection and more effective treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes in this challenging disease}

Currently, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard diagnostic method for determining COVID-19 infection. Various failures in the detection of the disease by means of laboratory samples have raised certain doubts about the characterisation of the infection and the spread of contacts. In clinical practice, chest radiography (RT) and chest computed tomography (CT) are extremely helpful and have been widely used in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. RT is the most common and widely available diagnostic imaging technique, however, its reading by less qualified personnel, in many cases with work overload, causes a high number of errors to be committed. Chest CT can be used for triage, diagnosis, assessment of severity, progression, and response to treatment. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown promise in image classification, showing that they can reduce diagnostic errors by at least matching the diagnostic performance of radiologists. This review shows how AI applied to thoracic radiology speeds up and improves diagnosis, allowing to optimise the workflow of radiologists. It can provide an objective evaluation and achieve a reduction in subjectivity and variability. AI can also help to optimise the resources and increase the efficiency in the management of COVID-19 infection.
Resumen
La enfermedad causada por el coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 es una pandemia con millones de casos confirmados en todo el mundo, y un alto número de fallecimientos. Actualmente, la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real (RT-PCR) es el método de diagnóstico estándar para determinar la infección por COVID-19. Diversos fracasos en la detección de la enfermedad por medio de muestras de laboratorio han planteado ciertas dudas sobre la caracterización de la infección y la propagación a los contactos. En la práctica clínica, la radiografía de tórax (RT) y la tomografía computarizada (TC) de tórax son extremadamente útiles y se han utilizado extensamente en la detección y el diagnóstico de la COVID-19. La RT es la técnica de diagnóstico por imagen más común, y la que está más ampliamente disponible, sin embargo, su lectura por personal menos cualificado, en muchos casos con sobrecarga de trabajo, hace que se cometa un gran número de errores. La TC de tórax se puede utilizar para el triaje, el diagnóstico, la evaluación de la gravedad, la progresión y la respuesta al tratamiento. Actualmente, los algoritmos de inteligencia artificial (IA) han resultado prometedores en la clasificación de imágenes, mostrando que pueden reducir los errores de diagnóstico, como mínimo igualando el rendimiento diagnóstico de los radiólogos. Esta revisión muestra cómo la IA aplicada a la RT acelera y mejora el diagnóstico, lo que permite optimizar el flujo de trabajo de los radiólogos. Puede proporcionar una evaluación objetiva y lograr una reducción de la subjetividad y la variabilidad. La IA también puede ayudar a optimizar los recursos y aumentar la eficiencia en la gestión de la infección por COVID-19.}

The authors highlight “The Good” of turnaround time as a useful quality metric that guides patient outcomes, organizational performance, and revenue generation, and they discuss how it has been implemented at their institution to positively influence workflow and guide departmental staffing. The “bad” implications of TAT are discussed, which can strain radiology departmental workflows and propagate issues such as delays in finalizing reports for inpatient and outpatient worklists in the setting of rapidly growing imaging volumes. Broader systemic issues of TAT are discussed within “The Ugly” section of this review, which highlights TAT’s negative impact on resident education, physician burnout, and its creation of “New School” and “Old School” radiologist practices. The article provides further discussion of existing strategies and future directions that can mitigate the negative impacts of TAT, including various staffing models, approaches to optimize workflow systems, and methods for re-prioritizing STAT cases using artificial intelligence.

Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful new technological advance, capable of simultaneously learning from diverse data types, such as text, images, video, and audio. Because clinical decisions are usually based on information from multiple sources, multimodal AI has the potential to significantly improve clinical practice. However, unlike most developed multimodal AI workflows, clinical medicine is both a dynamic and interventional process in which the clinician continually learns about the patient's health and acts accordingly as data is collected. In this article we argue that multimodal clinical AI must be fully attuned to the particular challenges and constraints of the clinic, and clinician involvement is needed throughout development—not just at clinical deployment. We propose ways that clinician involvement can add value at each stage of the multimodal AI development pipeline, and argue for the establishment of actively managed multidisciplinary communities to work collaboratively towards the shared goal of improving the health of all.}

In this article, we review what constitutes a perceptual error, the existing models of radiologic image perception, the development of perceptual expertise and how it can be tested, perceptual learning methods in training radiologists, and why understanding perceptual expertise is still relevant in the era of artificial intelligence.

Résumé
L'intelligence artificielle progresse rapidement de la phase expérimentale à la phase de mise en œuvre dans de nombreux domaines, notamment la médecine. L'accès à de grands ensembles de données, la puissance croissante des ordinateurs et les avancées en matière d'algorithmes d'apprentissage ont permis de faire des pas de géant au chapitre du développement des applications d'intelligence artificielle. Au cours des cinq dernières années, des techniques comme l'apprentissage profond ont permis d'améliorer rapidement les capacités de reconnaissance d'images, de production de légendes d'images et de reconnaissance vocale. La radiologie est un domaine tout indiqué pour l'adoption précoce de ces techniques. L'intégration d'applications d'intelligence artificielle en radiologie au cours de la prochaine décennie devrait grandement améliorer la qualité, la valeur et la portée de la contribution de la radiologie aux soins des patients et à la santé de la population, en plus de révolutionner le travail des radiologistes. En sa qualité de porte-parole de la profession au Canada, l’Association canadienne des radiologistes (CAR) défend des normes de pratique élevées en imagerie centrée sur les patients, en apprentissage continu et en recherche. La CAR a mis sur pied un groupe de travail sur l'intelligence artificielle qui a pour mandat de discuter des enjeux liés à la pratique, aux politiques et à la prestation de soins relativement à l'introduction et à la mise en œuvre d'outils d'intelligence artificielle en radiologie.

The knee is the most commonly affected joint. However, there is no effective early diagnostic method for OA. The main pathological feature of OA is cartilage degeneration. Owing to the poor regenerative ability of chondrocytes, early detection of OA and prompt intervention are extremely important. The T2 relaxation time indicates changes in cartilage composition and responds to alterations in the early cartilage matrix. T2 mapping does not require contrast agents or special equipment, so it is widely used. Radiomics analysis methods are used to construct diagnostic or predictive models based on information extracted from clinical images. Owing to the development of artificial intelligence methods, radiomics has made excellent progress in segmentation and model construction. In this review, we summarize the progress of T2 mapping radiomics research methods in terms of T2 map acquisition, image postprocessing, and OA diagnosis or predictive model construction.}

The future dental and endodontic education must adapt to the current digitalized healthcare system in a hyper-connected world. The purpose of this scoping review was to investigate the ways an endodontic education curriculum could benefit from the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and overcome the limitations of this technology in the delivery of healthcare to patients.
Methods
An electronic search was carried out up to December 2023 using MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and a manual search of reference literature. Grey literature, ongoing clinical trials were also searched using ClinicalTrials.gov.
Results
The search identified 251 records, of which 35 were deemed relevant to artificial intelligence (AI) and Endodontic education. Areas in which AI might aid students with their didactic and clinical endodontic education were identified as follows: 1) radiographic interpretation; 2) differential diagnosis; 3) treatment planning and decision-making; 4) case difficulty assessment; 5) preclinical training; 6) advanced clinical simulation and case-based training, 7) real-time clinical guidance; 8) autonomous systems and robotics; 9) progress evaluation and personalized education; 10) calibration and standardization.
Conclusions
AI in endodontic education will support clinical and didactic teaching through individualized feedback; enhanced, augmented, and virtually generated training aids; automated detection and diagnosis; treatment planning and decision support; and AI-based student progress evaluation, and personalized education. Its implementation will inarguably change the current concept of teaching Endodontics. Dental educators would benefit from introducing AI in clinical and didactic pedagogy; however, they must be aware of AI's limitations and challenges to overcome.}

These result in characteristic imaging features in CT in which this review article will illustrated. Radiologists who interpret chest CT should be aware of these findings and pitfalls in their assessment of obese patients to avoid misdiagnosis. In addition, there are multiple technical challenges to CT scanning of obese patients to achieve diagnostic images. In this review article the pathological mechanisms underlying the imaging findings in the obese lung are presented, as well as technical considerations for optimal scanning and the typical imaging findings. An overall review of the increasing use of AI body morphometry and its use in lung cancer risk and outcome prediction is also explored.

Over the past decade, there has been a groundswell of research interest in computer-based methods for objectively quantifying fibrotic lung disease on high resolution CT of the chest. In the past 5 years, the arrival of deep learning-based image analysis has created exciting new opportunities for enhancing the understanding of, and the ability to interpret, fibrotic lung disease on CT. Specific unsolved problems for which computer-based imaging analysis might provide solutions include the development of reliable methods for assisting with diagnosis, detecting early disease, and predicting disease behaviour using baseline imaging data. However, to harness this technology, technical and societal challenges must be overcome. Large CT datasets will be needed to power the training of deep learning algorithms. Open science research and collaboration between academia and industry must be encouraged. Prospective clinical utility studies will be needed to test computer algorithm performance in real-world clinical settings and demonstrate patient benefit over current best practice. Finally, ethical standards, which ensure patient confidentiality and mitigate against biases in training datasets, that can be encoded in machine-learning systems will be needed as well as bespoke data governance and accountability frameworks to encourage buy-in from health-care professionals, patients, and the public.}

Purpose
This narrative review summarizes the original research in the field of in vivo osteoarthritis (OA) imaging between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2023.
Methods
A PubMed search was conducted using the following several terms pertaining to OA imaging, including but not limited to “Osteoarthritis / OA”, “Magnetic resonance imaging / MRI“, “X-ray” “Computed tomography / CT”, “artificial intelligence /AI”, “deep learning”, “machine learning”. This review is organized by topics including the anatomical structure of interest and modality, AI, challenges of OA imaging in the context of clinical trials, and imaging biomarkers in clinical trials and interventional studies. Ex vivo and animal studies were excluded from this review.
Results
Two hundred and forty-nine publications were relevant to in vivo human OA imaging. Among the articles included, the knee joint (61%) and MRI (42%) were the predominant anatomical area and imaging modalities studied. Marked heterogeneity of structural tissue damage in OA knees was reported, a finding of potential relevance to clinical trial inclusion. The use of AI continues to rise rapidly to be applied in various aspect of OA imaging research but a lack of generalizability beyond highly standardized datasets limit interpretation and wide-spread application. No pharmacologic clinical trials using imaging data as outcome measures have been published in the period of interest.
Conclusions
Recent advances in OA imaging continue to heavily weigh on the use of AI. MRI remains the most important modality with a growing role in outcome prediction and classification.}

Data on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental implant planning is insufficient.
Purpose
The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to analyze and evaluate articles that assess the effectiveness of AI algorithms in dental implant planning, specifically in detecting edentulous areas and evaluating bone dimensions.
Material and methods
A systematic review was conducted across the MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases. In addition, a manual search was performed. The inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed studies that examined the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic tools on dental radiographs for dental implant planning. The most recent search was conducted in January 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of the included articles.
Results
Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria for this review and focused on the application of AI in dental implant planning using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. The pooled data indicated an overall accuracy of 96% (95% CI=94% to 98%) for the mandible and 83% (95% CI=82% to 84%) for the maxilla in identifying edentulous areas for implant planning. Eight studies had a low risk of bias, 2 studies had some concern of bias, and 2 studies had a high risk of bias.
Conclusions
AI models have the potential to identify edentulous areas and provide measurements of bone as part of dental implant planning using CBCT images. However, additional well-conducted research is needed to enhance the accuracy, generalizability, and applicability of AI-based approaches.}

abstract = {Background
The complexity of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) multidisciplinary team (MDT) is continually growing, leading to rising clinician workload, time pressures, and demands. This increases heterogeneity or ‘noise’ within decision-making for patients with oesophageal cancer (OC) and may lead to inconsistent treatment decisions. In recent decades, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically the branch of machine learning (ML) has led to a paradigm shift in the perceived utility of statistical modelling within healthcare. Within oesophageal cancer (OC) care, ML techniques have already been applied with early success to the analyses of histological samples and radiology imaging; however, it has not yet been applied to the MDT itself where such models are likely to benefit from incorporating information-rich, diverse datasets to increase predictive model accuracy.
Methods
This review discusses the current role the MDT plays in modern UGI cancer care as well as the utilisation of ML techniques to date using histological and radiological data to predict treatment response, prognostication, nodal disease evaluation, and even resectability within OC.
Results
The review finds that an emerging body of evidence is growing in support of ML tools within multiple domains relevant to decision-making within OC including automated histological analysis and radiomics. However, to date, no specific application has been directed to the MDT itself which routinely assimilates this information.
Conclusions
The authors feel the UGI MDT offers an information-rich, diverse array of data from which ML offers the potential to standardise, automate, and produce more consistent, data-driven MDT decisions.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

abstract = {Background
Manual detection of brain metastases is both laborious and inconsistent, driving the need for more efficient solutions. Accordingly, our systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of deep learning algorithms in detecting and segmenting brain metastases from various primary origins in MRI images.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to May 24, 2023, which yielded 42 relevant studies for our analysis. We assessed the quality of these studies using the QUADAS-2 and CLAIM tools. Using a random-effect model, we calculated the pooled lesion-wise dice score as well as patient-wise and lesion-wise sensitivity. We performed subgroup analyses to investigate the influence of factors such as publication year, study design, training center of the model, validation methods, slice thickness, model input dimensions, MRI sequences fed to the model, and the specific deep learning algorithms employed. Additionally, meta-regression analyses were carried out considering the number of patients in the studies, count of MRI manufacturers, count of MRI models, training sample size, and lesion number.
Results
Our analysis highlighted that deep learning models, particularly the U-Net and its variants, demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy. Enhanced detection sensitivity was observed with an increased diversity in MRI hardware, both in terms of manufacturer and model variety. Furthermore, slice thickness was identified as a significant factor influencing lesion-wise detection sensitivity. Overall, the pooled results indicated a lesion-wise dice score of 79%, with patient-wise and lesion-wise sensitivities at 86% and 87%, respectively.
Conclusions
The study underscores the potential of deep learning in improving brain metastasis diagnostics and treatment planning. Still, more extensive cohorts and larger meta-analysis are needed for more practical and generalizable algorithms. Future research should prioritize these areas to advance the field. This study was funded by the Gen. & Mrs. M.C. Peng Fellowship and registered under PROSPERO (CRD42023427776).}

Sustaining trust and trustworthiness is a key goal of governance, which is necessary to promote collaboration among all stakeholders and to ensure the responsible development and implementation of AI in radiology and other areas of clinical work. In this paper, the nature of AI governance in biomedicine is discussed along with its limitations. It is argued that radiologists must assume a more active role in propelling medicine into the digital age. In this respect, professional responsibilities include inquiring into the clinical and social value of AI, alleviating deficiencies in technical knowledge in order to facilitate ethical evaluation, supporting the recognition, and removal of biases, engaging the “black box” obstacle, and brokering a new social contract on informational use and security. In essence, a much closer integration of ethics, laws, and good practices is needed to ensure that AI governance achieves its normative goals.}

These nanostructural systems serve primarily as nanocarriers for the bioactive chemotherapeutic drugs, which are delivered to the target tumor location without harming healthy or normal cells. Another adaptable strategy based on nanotechnology principles is useful for early cancer detection. These two promising approaches play a significant role in notable CRC management or control. Researchers, notably those in the medical field, are particularly interested in breakthroughs in nanotechnology combined with artificial intelligence (AI), a subfield of computer science, to support target delivery and extremely early-stage cancer diagnosis. The present study emphasizes the use of AI and nanotechnology principles for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. The use of AI in the medical literature is tremendous, deep learning techniques allow AI to extract characteristics from enormous amounts of healthcare data with the use of complex algorithms, and then to apply the results to assist clinical practice. The primary kind of AI that analyzes structured data like imaging, genomic, and EP is machine learning (ML). Machine learning algorithms try to group the characteristics of people or predict the likelihood of medical consequences. The speed and accuracy of the sequenced procedures used to collect omics data are improved by nanobiotechnology. In order to more accurately predict the prognosis for cancer, patient survival time, and disease progression, AI paired with nanotechnology can analyze and assess crucial information based on historical data.

abstract = {COVID-19 has infected 77.4 million people worldwide and has caused 1.7 million fatalities as of December 21, 2020. The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings.}

Conclusions
This study provides a summary of AI-related research in healthcare, it discusses the challenges and proposes open research questions for further research. Robotics has taken huge leaps in improving the healthcare services in a variety of medical sectors, including oncology and surgical interventions. In addition, robots are now replacing human assistants as they learn to become more sociable and reliable. However, there are challenges that must still be addressed to enable the use of medical robots in diagnostics and interventions. AI for medical imaging eliminates subjectivity in a visual diagnostic procedure and allows for the combining of medical imaging with clinical data, lifestyle risks and demographics. Disadvantages of AI solutions for radiology include both a lack of transparency and dedication to narrowed diagnostic questions. Designing an optimal automatic classifier should incorporate both expert knowledge on a disease and state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. AI in precision medicine and oncology allows for risk stratification due to genomics aberrations discovered on molecular testing. To summarize, AI cannot substitute a medical doctor. However, medicine may benefit from robotics, a CAD, and AI-based personalized approach.}

abstract = {Background
The rapid progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is having a substantial impact on health care (HC) delivery and the physician-patient interaction.
Objective
This scoping review aims to offer a thorough analysis of the current status of integrating AI into medical practice as well as the apprehensions expressed by HC professionals (HCPs) over its application.
Methods
This scoping review used the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to examine articles that investigated the apprehensions of HCPs about medical AI. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 32 of an initial 217 studies (14.7%) were selected for the final analysis. We aimed to develop an attitude range that accurately captured the unfavorable emotions of HCPs toward medical AI. We achieved this by selecting attitudes and ranking them on a scale that represented the degree of aversion, ranging from mild skepticism to intense fear. The ultimate depiction of the scale was as follows: skepticism, reluctance, anxiety, resistance, and fear.
Results
In total, 3 themes were identified through the process of thematic analysis. National surveys performed among HCPs aimed to comprehensively analyze their current emotions, worries, and attitudes regarding the integration of AI in the medical industry. Research on technostress primarily focused on the psychological dimensions of adopting AI, examining the emotional reactions, fears, and difficulties experienced by HCPs when they encountered AI-powered technology. The high-level perspective category included studies that took a broad and comprehensive approach to evaluating overarching themes, trends, and implications related to the integration of AI technology in HC. We discovered 15 sources of attitudes, which we classified into 2 distinct groups: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic group focused on HCPs’ inherent professional identity, encompassing their tasks and capacities. Conversely, the extrinsic group pertained to their patients and the influence of AI on patient care. Next, we examined the shared themes and made suggestions to potentially tackle the problems discovered. Ultimately, we analyzed the results in relation to the attitude scale, assessing the degree to which each attitude was portrayed.
Conclusions
The solution to addressing resistance toward medical AI appears to be centered on comprehensive education, the implementation of suitable legislation, and the delineation of roles. Addressing these issues may foster acceptance and optimize AI integration, enhancing HC delivery while maintaining ethical standards. Due to the current prominence and extensive research on regulation, we suggest that further research could be dedicated to education.}

Ultimately, 32 articles that were published from June 2016 - November 2020 were included in our review given their presentation of original information and relevance to clinical AI imaging and ethics. Several themes appeared and allowed for the following recommendations: 1. Protocols explaining how patient data will be utilized should be provided to and implemented by providers. 2. Differences in data regulations among industry partners must be considered for successful implementation of AI in radiology, and protections against entities with a financial interest in patient data must be included. 3. Providers should receive education and training on basic AI algorithm methodology to allow them to explain risks to patients and obtain informed consent. 4. Radiologists and AI programmers should work together to allow for feedback, collaboration, and the development of more clinically impactful and ethical AI applications. We conclude by recommending collaboration between providers and programmers with a focus on existing AI platforms over developing new algorithms, as there is a lack of consensus on the proper applications of and regulations needed for already existing technologies.

This review addresses this knowledge gap using articles from Science Direct, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science between 2017 and 2023. The authors begin with the motivation for using DL in orthopaedics, including its ability to enhance diagnosis and treatment planning. The review then covers various applications of DL in orthopaedics, including fracture detection, detection of supraspinatus tears using MRI, osteoarthritis, prediction of types of arthroplasty implants, bone age assessment, and detection of joint-specific soft tissue disease. We also examine the challenges for implementing DL in orthopaedics, including the scarcity of data to train DL and the lack of interpretability, as well as possible solutions to these common pitfalls. Our work highlights the requirements to achieve trustworthiness in the outcomes generated by DL, including the need for accuracy, explainability, and fairness in the DL models. We pay particular attention to fusion techniques as one of the ways to increase trustworthiness, which have also been used to address the common multimodality in orthopaedics. Finally, we have reviewed the approval requirements set forth by the US Food and Drug Administration to enable the use of DL applications. As such, we aim to have this review function as a guide for researchers to develop a reliable DL application for orthopaedic tasks from scratch for use in the market.}

In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable.

The successful integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice is contingent upon physicians’ comprehension of AI principles and its applications. Therefore, it is essential for medical education curricula to incorporate AI topics and concepts, providing future physicians with the foundational knowledge and skills needed. However, there is a knowledge gap in the current understanding and availability of structured AI curriculum frameworks tailored for medical education, which serve as vital guides for instructing and facilitating the learning process.
Objective
The overall aim of this study is to synthesize knowledge from the literature on curriculum frameworks and current educational programs that focus on the teaching and learning of AI for medical students, residents, and practicing physicians.
Methods
We followed a validated framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance for scoping reviews.

Papers were limited to English and French languages. This review included papers that describe curriculum frameworks for teaching and learning AI in medicine, irrespective of country. All types of papers and study designs were included, except conference abstracts and protocols. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, read the full texts, and extracted data using a validated data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought. We adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for reporting the results.
Results
Of the 5104 papers screened, 21 papers relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. In total, 90% (19/21) of the papers altogether described 30 current or previously offered educational programs, and 10% (2/21) of the papers described elements of a curriculum framework. One framework describes a general approach to integrating AI curricula throughout the medical learning continuum and another describes a core curriculum for AI in ophthalmology. No papers described a theory, pedagogy, or framework that guided the educational programs.
Conclusions
This review synthesizes recent advancements in AI curriculum frameworks and educational programs within the domain of medical education. To build on this foundation, future researchers are encouraged to engage in a multidisciplinary approach to curriculum redesign.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a chronic inflammatory condition with global prevalence and varying incidence. The IBD pathogenesis involves intricate interactions among genetic, host and environmental factors, leading to dysregulated immune responses and chronic intestinal inflammation. Alongside elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and altered miRNAs expression, more studies highlight significant dysbiosis in both fecal and ileal microbiota of IBD patients. This dysbiosis is characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory and mucin-degrading bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp., Escherichia spp.) and a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) -producing microbes (e.g., Roseburia spp., Faecalibacterium spp.) which play a protective role in gut health. Diet emerges as a key environmental factor influencing IBD onset and progression and recent advancements in”omics” technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, provide a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions between genes, gut microbiota (GM) and nutrition. Finally, new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), further enhance findings by enabling data integration and personalized dietary strategies. In this scenario, this review aims to summarize accumulating data on the effects of dietary interventions in IBD patients and introduce the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating precision dietary approaches to improve IBD management.}

The emergence of protein-protein interaction network studies in 2001 marked a turning point and promoted a holistic approach that considers the human body as an interconnected system. This is particularly evident in the study of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, which are critical for understanding health and disease. Understanding these complex interactions requires integrating multi-scale, heterogeneous data from molecular to organ levels, encompassing both omics (e.g., genomics, proteomics, microbiomics) and non-omics data (e.g., imaging, clinical phenotypes). Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly multi-modal models, has demonstrated significant potential in analyzing CNS-peripheral organ interactions by processing vast, heterogeneous datasets. Specifically, AI facilitates the identification of biomarkers, prediction of therapeutic targets, and simulation of drug effects on multi-organ systems, thereby paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

Methods
A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and IEEEXplore was conducted between January 2015 and June 2021 to collect systematic reviews using a combination of keywords related to the domains of universal health coverage, health emergencies protection, and better health and wellbeing as defined by the WHO’s PGW13 and EPW. Eligibility criteria was based on methodological quality and the inclusion of practical implementation of artificial intelligence. Records were classified and labeled using ICD-11 categories into the domains of the GPW13. Descriptors related to the area of implementation, type of modeling, data entities, outcomes and implementation on care delivery were extracted using a structured form and methodological aspects of the included reviews studies was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist.
Results
The search strategy resulted in the screening of 815 systematic reviews from which 203 were assessed for eligibility and 129 were included in the review. The most predominant domain for artificial intelligence applications was Universal Health Coverage (N = 98) followed by Health Emergencies (N = 16) and Better Health and Wellbeing (N = 15). Neoplasms area on Universal Health Coverage was the disease area featuring most of the applications (21.7 %, N = 28). The reviews featured analytics primarily over both public and private data sources (67.44 %, N = 87). The most used type of data was medical imaging (31.8 %, N = 41) and predictors based on regions of interest and clinical data. The most prominent subdomain of Artificial Intelligence was Machine Learning (43.4 %, N = 56), in which Support Vector Machine method was predominant (20.9 %, N = 27). Regarding the purpose, the application of Artificial Intelligence I is focused on the prediction of the diseases (36.4 %, N = 47). With respect to the validation, more than a half of the reviews (54.3 %, N = 70) did not report a validation procedure and, whenever available, the main performance indicator was the accuracy (28.7 %, N = 37). According to the methodological quality assessment, a third of the reviews (34.9 %, N = 45) implemented methods for analysis the risk of bias and the overall AMSTAR score below was 5 (4.01 ± 1.93) on all the included systematic reviews.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence is being used for disease modelling, diagnose, classification and prediction in the three domains of GPW13. However, the evidence is often limited to laboratory and the level of adoption is largely unbalanced between ICD-11 categoriesand diseases. Data availability is a determinant factor on the developmental stage of artificial intelligence applications. Most of the reviewed studies show a poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias, which limits the reproducibility of the results and the reliability of translating these applications to real clinical scenarios. The analyzed papers show results only in laboratory and testing scenarios and not in clinical trials nor case studies, limiting the supporting evidence to transfer artificial intelligence to actual care delivery.}

There are many radiological datasets for breast cancer, some which have supported the development of AI medical devices for breast cancer screening and image classification. This review aims to identify mammography datasets (including digitised screen film mammography, 2D digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis) used in the development of AI technologies and present their characteristics, including their transparency of documentation, content, populations included and accessibility.
Materials and methods
MEDLINE and Google Dataset searches identified studies describing AI technology development and referencing breast imaging datasets up to June 2024. The characteristics of each dataset are summarised. In particular, the accompanying documentation was reviewed with a focus on diversity and inclusion of populations represented within each dataset.
Results
254 datasets were referenced in the literature search, 190 were privately held, 36 had barriers which prevented access, and 28 were accessible. Most datasets originated from Europe, East Asia and North America. There was poor reporting of individuals' attributes: 32 (12 %) datasets reported race or ethnicity; 76 (30 %) reported female/male categories with only one dataset explicitly defining whether these categories represented sex or gender attributes.
Conclusion
Through this review, we demonstrate gaps in the data landscape for mammography, highlighting poor representation globally. To ensure datasets in breast imaging have maximum utility for researchers, their characteristics should be documented and limitations of datasets, such as their representativeness of populations and settings, should inform scientific efforts to translate data-driven insights into technologies and discoveries.}

Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid oncologists in future cancer treatment management.}

To address these limitations, agentic systems have emerged as a new paradigm. By embedding LLMs within frameworks that enable reasoning, planning, and action, agentic systems extend LLM capabilities to dynamic interaction with users, tools, and data sources. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the foundations, architectures, and operational mechanisms of agentic systems, focusing on their applications in medical imaging and radiology. It summarizes key developments in the literature, including recent multi-agent frameworks for automated radiomics pipelines, and discusses the potential benefits of these systems in enhancing the reproducibility, interpretability, and accessibility of AI-driven workflows.

As no single golden standard modality for diagnosing IBD exists, the differential diagnosis among UC, CD, and non-IBD involves a multidisciplinary approach, considering professional groups that include gastroenterologists, endoscopists, radiologists, and pathologists. In this context, histological examination of endoscopic or surgical specimens plays a fundamental role. Nevertheless, in differentiating IBD from non-IBD colitis, the histopathological evaluation of the morphological lesions is limited by sampling and subjective human judgment, leading to potential diagnostic discrepancies. To overcome these limitations, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are emerging to enable automated analysis of medical images with advantages in accuracy, precision, and speed of investigation, increasing interest in the histological analysis of gastrointestinal inflammation. This review aims to provide an overview of the most recent knowledge and advances in AI methods, summarizing its applications in the histopathological analysis of endoscopic biopsies from IBD patients, and discussing its strengths and limitations in daily clinical practice.}

Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many image-processing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can self-correct mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathology-specific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology laboratory workflow, education, and training.}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) models were created to address health-care resource constraints. Previous research shows that health-care datasets often have limitations, leading to biased AI technologies. This systematic review assessed datasets used for AI development during the pandemic, identifying several deficiencies. Datasets were identified by screening articles from MEDLINE and using Google Dataset Search. 192 datasets were analysed for metadata completeness, composition, data accessibility, and ethical considerations. Findings revealed substantial gaps: only 48% of datasets documented individuals’ country of origin, 43% reported age, and under 25% included sex, gender, race, or ethnicity. Information on data labelling, ethical review, or consent was frequently missing. Many datasets reused data with inadequate traceability. Notably, historical paediatric chest x-rays appeared in some datasets without acknowledgment. These deficiencies highlight the need for better data quality and transparent documentation to lessen the risk that biased AI models are developed in future health emergencies.}

Recently, some applications of DL and ML in Computed Tomography (CT) scans for low dose optimization were developed. Nowadays, DL algorithms are used in CT to perform replacement of missing data (processing technique) such as low dose to high dose, sparse view to full view, low resolution to high resolution, and limited angle to full angle. Thus, DL comes with a new vision to process biomedical data imagery from CT scan. It becomes important to develop architectures and/or methods based on DL algorithms for minimizing radiation during a CT scan exam thanks to reconstruction and processing techniques.
Methods
This paper describes DL for CT scan low dose optimization, shows examples described in the literature, briefly discusses new methods used in CT scan image processing, and offers conclusions. We based our study on the literature and proposed a pipeline for low dose CT scan image reconstruction. Our proposed pipeline relies on DL and the Spark Framework using MapReduce programming. We discuss our proposed pipeline with those proposed in the literature to conclude the efficiency and importance.
Results
An architecture for low dose optimization using CT imagery is suggested. We used the Spark Framework to design the architecture. The proposed architecture relies on DL, and permits us to develop efficient and appropriate methods to process dose optimization with CT scan imagery. The real implementation of our pipeline for image denoising shows that we can reduce the radiation dose, and use our proposed pipeline to improve the quality of the captured image.
Conclusion
The proposed architecture based on DL is complete and enables faster processing of biomedical CT imagery as compared with prior methods described in the literature.}

Pathology will be a key area where the impact of AI will be felt. With more and more laboratories making the transition to digital pathology this will provide the key infrastructure in which to deploy these tools and their use will start to become a reality in diagnostic practice. The potential of AI in pathology is to create image analysis tools which could either be used for diagnostic support or to derive novel insights into disease biology, in addition to those achievable with a human observer. Some examples providing diagnostic support currently exist for a limited, but expanding number of applications, such as tumour detection, automated tumour grading, immunohistochemistry scoring, and predicting mutation status. There are a number of challenges to consider, not least the validation and regulatory framework for these tools. In this article, we set out an overview of AI in histopathology, discuss its potential workflow applications, and give key examples of the potential for AI in clinical practice. Considerations for the implementation of AI in practice are also explored.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly embedded in Radiography research and practice, extending beyond diagnostic support and workflow optimisation to non-patient-facing applications. Generative AI (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have been used in radiography research, generating synthetic data, assisting in literature reviews, and facilitating multilingual communication. This narrative review aims to explore the opportunities, challenges, and implications of LLM integration in radiography research.
Key findings
A narrative review approach was employed, identifying relevant publications and integrating author-led examples, including survey design, translation support, and workflow integration. The literature shows that LLMs accelerate research processes by supporting systematic literature retrieval, enhancing survey development, generating synthetic imaging data, streamlining data analysis and enhancing internationalisation. Case studies highlighted measurable benefits, such as improved CT image quality and reduced examination times through AI-assisted communication. However, challenges included hallucinated outputs, embedded biases, risks to privacy, regulatory challenges and environmental costs of model training.
Conclusion
GenAI and LLMs offer transformative opportunities for radiography research across multiple stages, from study design to dissemination. Nonetheless, integration must be accompanied by validation against expert-reviewed datasets, transparent reporting, and ethical safeguards to ensure reliability.
Implications for practice
Radiography researchers should adopt GenAI tools with a “trust but verify” approach: leveraging their efficiency while verifying outputs through expert oversight. Training, governance, and validation frameworks are essential for safe implementation, ensuring these technologies augment rather than replace human expertise in radiography research.}

Notwithstanding the tremendous success of oncological AI in such fields as lung carcinoma, breast tumor and brain malignancy, less attention has been devoted to investigating the influence of AI on gynecologic oncology. Hereby, this review sheds light on the ever-increasing contribution of state-of-the-art AI techniques to the refined risk stratification and whole-course management of patients with gynecologic tumors, in particular, cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancer, centering on information and features extracted from clinical data (electronic health records), cancer imaging including radiological imaging, colposcopic images, cytological and histopathological digital images, and molecular profiling (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and so forth). However, there are still noteworthy challenges beyond performance validation. Thus, this work further describes the limitations and challenges faced in the real-word implementation of AI models, as well as potential solutions to address these issues.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is paramount in the assessment of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Yet, HRCT interpretation of ILDs may be hampered by inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical image analysis. This technology has the potential to advance patient care in ILD. We aimed to systematically evaluate the application of AI for the analysis of ILD in HRCT.
Materials and Methods
We searched MEDLINE/PubMed databases for original publications of deep learning for ILD analysis on chest CT. The search included studies published up to March 1, 2021. The risk of bias evaluation included tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and the modified Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklist.
Results
Data was extracted from 19 retrospective studies. Deep learning techniques included detection, segmentation, and classification of ILD on HRCT. Most studies focused on the classification of ILD into different morphological patterns. Accuracies of 78%-91% were achieved. Two studies demonstrated near-expert performance for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool identified a high risk of bias in 15/19 (78.9%) of the studies.
Conclusion
AI has the potential to contribute to the radiologic diagnosis and classification of ILD. However, the accuracy performance is still not satisfactory, and research is limited by a small number of retrospective studies. Hence, the existing published data may not be sufficiently reliable. Only well-designed prospective controlled studies can accurately assess the value of existing AI tools for ILD evaluation.}

Objectives
As an increasing number of studies apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in osteoarthritis (OA) detection, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the data on diagnostic performance metrics of AI, and to compare them with clinicians’ performance.
Materials and methods
A search in PubMed and Scopus was performed to find studies published up to April 2022 that evaluated and/or validated an AI algorithm for the detection or classification of OA. We performed a meta-analysis to pool the data on the metrics of diagnostic performance. Subgroup analysis based on the involved joint and meta-regression based on multiple parameters were performed to find potential sources of heterogeneity. The risk of bias was assessed using Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool reporting guidelines.
Results
Of the 61 studies included, 27 studies with 91 contingency tables provided sufficient data to enter the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivities for AI algorithms and clinicians on internal validation test sets were 88% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86,91) and 80% (95% CI: 68,88) and pooled specificities were 81% (95% CI: 75,85) and 79% (95% CI: 80,85), respectively. At external validation, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for AI algorithms were 94% (95% CI: 90,97) and 91% (95% CI: 77,97), respectively.
Conclusion
Although the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the potential pitfalls in the included studies, the promising role of AI as a diagnostic adjunct to radiologists is indisputable.}

Periodontal disease, which affects the gums and bone surrounding the teeth, is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. Cariology, the study of dental decay, is also an important area of focus for AI research. AI algorithms can be used to analyze dental images and detect early signs of decay that may be missed by human dentists. The review first discusses the history of AI in healthcare and then highlights some of the ways technology has improved dentistry and then describe some basic AI models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and random forest. The article then delves into how AI is involved in periodontal disease, cariology, endodontics, prosthodontics, and orthodontics including classifying different types of periodontal disease, identifying areas of bone loss, determining the severity of the disease, analyzing dental images, and detecting early signs of diseases. On the other hand, the application of AI in dentistry is relatively uncommon because implementing AI technologies in dentistry presents several challenges that need to be addressed for successful implementation of AI technologies in dentistry.}

The range and speed of CT scanning improved from the introduction of multidetector-row CT scanners with wide-array detectors and faster gantry rotation speeds. To tackle concerns over rising radiation doses from its increasing use and to improve image quality, CT reconstruction techniques evolved from filtered back projection to commercial release of iterative reconstruction techniques, and recently, of deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction. These newer reconstruction techniques enable improved or retained image quality versus filtered back projection at lower radiation doses. DL can aid in image reconstruction with training data without total reliance on the physical model of the imaging process, unique artifacts of PCD-CT due to charge sharing, K-escape, fluorescence x-ray emission, and pulse pileups can be handled in the data-driven fashion. With sufficiently reconstructed images, a well-designed network can be trained to upgrade image quality over a practical/clinical threshold or define new/killer applications. Besides, the much smaller detector pixel for PCD-CT can lead to huge computational costs with traditional model-based iterative reconstruction methods whereas deep networks can be much faster with training and validation. In this review, we present techniques, applications, uses, and limitations of deep learning-based image reconstruction methods in CT.}

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging method for diagnosing breast cancer and assessing treatment response. Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer new opportunities to identify patterns in imaging data, supporting personalized post-neoadjuvant surgical decisions. This paper reviewed breast MRI-based AI models for predicting outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy, with a focus on evidence from the Western Pacific region, to evaluate the quality of existing models, discuss their inherent limitations, and outline potential future directions. A literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science identified 51 relevant studies in the region, with the majority conducted in China, followed by South Korea and Japan. Most studies focused on predicting pathologic complete response (pCR), with a median sample size of 152 and largely retrospective single-center designs. Model performance was commonly assessed using validation sets, with pooled sensitivity and specificity for pCR prediction showing promising results. Models incorporating multitemporal MRI features were associated with improved accuracy. While MRI-based AI models show potential for guiding surgical planning, improved methodological quality and algorithmic explainability are needed to facilitate clinical translation.}

In this review, we investigated Transfer Learning (TL) architectures for automated medical image analysis. We discovered that TL has been applied to a wide range of medical imaging tasks, such as segmentation, object identification, disease categorization, severity grading, to name a few. We could establish that TL provides high quality decision support and requires less training data when compared to traditional deep learning methods. These advantageous properties arise from the fact that TL models have already been trained on large generic datasets and a task specific dataset is only used to customize the model. This eliminates the need to train the models from scratch. Our review shows that AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet are the most widely used TL models for medical image analysis. We found that these models can understand medical images, and the customization refines the ability, making these TL models useful tools for medical image analysis.}

Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) algorithms have emerged to enhance CT image quality by mitigating these artifacts. This review emphasizes the significance of quantifying MAR algorithms, details common quantification metrics, and presents findings from diverse CT scanner studies. MAR techniques effectively reduce metal artifacts and enhance CT imaging. Metrics like noise levels, Contrast-to-Noise ratio (CNR), CT number accuracy, and Metal Artifact Index (MAI) quantify their efficacy. Varied CT scanner experiments with diverse metal implants display improved CT number accuracy, noise reduction, and artifact management through MAR algorithms. However, secondary artifacts and altered metal size accuracy are potential drawbacks that need attention. Deep Learning-based Reconstruction (DLR) is an expanding approach using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for CT image reconstruction. DLR generates low-dose CT images with high spatial resolution. Recent clinical deployments highlight DLR's potential in generating low-noise, texture-rich images, and superior artifact reduction. Moreover, DLR techniques exhibit promise in addressing beam hardening artifacts. While MAR algorithms have revolutionized CT imaging, DLR techniques are emerging as potential alternatives. Current DLR implementations like TrueFidelity and Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine (AiCE) demonstrate promising outcomes. However, challenges in implementation and machine learning model reliability require further exploration. In conclusion, MAR algorithms enhance CT imaging quality by rectifying artifacts near metal implants, while DLR methods offer a promising path for radiation dose reduction and image refinement. Combining both approaches might pave the way for future CT imaging advancements.}

AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms can analyze vast quantities of increasingly complex clinical datasets from electronic medical records to assist clinicians in diagnosing and treating sepsis earlier than traditional methods. Our review highlights how these models can predict the risk of sepsis and organ failure even before it occurs. This gives providers additional time to plan and execute treatment plans, thereby avoiding increasing complications associated with delayed diagnosis of sepsis. The potential for cost savings with AI implementation is also discussed, including improving workflow efficiencies, reducing administrative costs, and improving healthcare outcomes.

Purpose
This narrative review summarizes the original research in the field of in vivo osteoarthritis (OA) imaging between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2023.
Methods
A PubMed search was conducted using the following several terms pertaining to OA imaging, including but not limited to “Osteoarthritis / OA”, “Magnetic resonance imaging / MRI“, “X-ray” “Computed tomography / CT”, “artificial intelligence /AI”, “deep learning”, “machine learning”. This review is organized by topics including the anatomical structure of interest and modality, AI, challenges of OA imaging in the context of clinical trials, and imaging biomarkers in clinical trials and interventional studies. Ex vivo and animal studies were excluded from this review.
Results
Two hundred and forty-nine publications were relevant to in vivo human OA imaging. Among the articles included, the knee joint (61%) and MRI (42%) were the predominant anatomical area and imaging modalities studied. Marked heterogeneity of structural tissue damage in OA knees was reported, a finding of potential relevance to clinical trial inclusion. The use of AI continues to rise rapidly to be applied in various aspect of OA imaging research but a lack of generalizability beyond highly standardized datasets limit interpretation and wide-spread application. No pharmacologic clinical trials using imaging data as outcome measures have been published in the period of interest.
Conclusions
Recent advances in OA imaging continue to heavily weigh on the use of AI. MRI remains the most important modality with a growing role in outcome prediction and classification.}

It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture—data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action—are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.}

Currently, AI in Ophthalmology is mainly focused on improving disease classification and supporting decision-making when treating ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, most of the DL systems (DLSs) developed thus far remain in the research stage and only a handful are able to achieve clinical translation. This phenomenon is due to a combination of factors including concerns over security and privacy, poor generalizability, trust and explainability issues, unfavorable end-user perceptions and uncertain economic value. Overcoming this challenge would require a combination approach. Firstly, emerging techniques such as federated learning (FL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autonomous AI and blockchain will be playing an increasingly critical role to enhance privacy, collaboration and DLS performance. Next, compliance to reporting and regulatory guidelines, such as CONSORT-AI and STARD-AI, will be required to in order to improve transparency, minimize abuse and ensure reproducibility. Thirdly, frameworks will be required to obtain patient consent, perform ethical assessment and evaluate end-user perception. Lastly, proper health economic assessment (HEA) must be performed to provide financial visibility during the early phases of DLS development. This is necessary to manage resources prudently and guide the development of DLS.}

Background
Diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical practice. Worldwide, there is increased demand for diagnostic services, exacerbating workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may improve diagnostic efficiency, accuracy, and access. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is key to informing implementation of complex interventions. We systematically reviewed the literature on stakeholder perspectives on diagnostic AI, including all English-language peer-reviewed primary qualitative or mixed-methods research.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE/Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science (22/2/2023 and updated 8/2/2024). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist informed critical appraisal. We used a ‘best-fit’ framework approach for analysis, using the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, Sustainability (NASSS) framework. This study was pre-registered (PROSPERO CRD42022313782).
Findings
We screened 16,577 articles and included 44. 689 participants were interviewed, and 402 participated in focus groups. Four stakeholder groups were described: patients, clinicians, researchers and healthcare leaders. We found an under-representation of patients, researchers and leaders across articles. We summarise the differences and relationships between each group in a conceptual model, hinging on the establishment of trust, engagement and collaboration. We present a modification of the NASSS framework, tailored to diagnostic AI.
Interpretation
We provide guidance for future research and implementation of diagnostic AI, highlighting the importance of representing all stakeholder groups. We suggest that implementation strategies consider how any proposed software fits within the extended NASSS-AI framework, and how stakeholder priorities and concerns have been addressed.
Funding
RK is supported by an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowship grant (NIHR302562), which funded patient and public involvement activities, and access to Covidence.}

It answers a need for more attention to the human factors influencing clinical AI performance and more transparent reporting of clinical studies investigating AI systems. Given the rapid expansion of AI systems and the concentration of related studies in radiology, these new standards are likely to find a place in radiological literature in the near future. This review highlights some of the specificities of AI as complex intervention, why a new reporting guideline was needed for early stage, live evaluation of this technology, and how DECIDE-AI and other AI reporting guidelines can be useful to radiologists and researchers.}

Capabilities that AI algorithms currently provide include detection, segmentation, classification, and quantification of pathological findings. Artificial intelligence software have created challenges for the traditional United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process for medical devices given their abilities to evolve over time with incremental data input. Currently, there are 190 FDA-approved radiology AI-based software devices, 42 of which pertain specifically to thoracic radiology. The majority of these algorithms are approved for the detection and/or analysis of pulmonary nodules, for monitoring placement of endotracheal tubes and indwelling catheters, for detection of emergent findings, and for assessment of pulmonary parenchyma; however, as technology evolves, there are many other potential applications that can be explored. For example, evaluation of non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung diseases, synthesis of imaging, clinical and/or laboratory data to yield comprehensive diagnoses, and survival or prognosis prediction of certain pathologies. With increasing physician and developer engagement, transparency and frequent communication between developers and regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, AI medical devices will be able to provide a critical supplement to patient management and ultimately enhance physicians' ability to improve patient care.}

Advanced imaging, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound Elastography (UE), Computed Tomography (CT) and scintigraphy (PET, SPECT) offers the opportunity to non-invasively retrieve structural, functional and molecular information that could detect changes in renal tissue properties and functionality. Currently, the ability of artificial intelligence to turn conventional medical imaging into a full-automated diagnostic tool is widely investigated. In addition to the qualitative analysis performed on renal medical imaging, texture analysis was integrated with machine learning techniques as a quantification of renal tissue heterogeneity, providing a promising complementary tool in renal function decline prediction. Interestingly, deep learning holds the ability to be a novel approach of renal function diagnosis. This paper proposes a survey that covers both qualitative and quantitative analysis applied to novel medical imaging techniques to monitor the decline of renal function. First, we summarize the use of different medical imaging modalities to monitor CKD and then, we show the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide renal function evaluation from segmentation to disease prediction, discussing how texture analysis and machine learning techniques have emerged in recent clinical researches in order to improve renal dysfunction monitoring and prediction. The paper gives a summary about the role of AI in renal segmentation.}

Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more objective diagnosis. Although the term ‘AI’ is commonly used, recent success in its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images.

abstract = {Background
Magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings in Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [NMOSD] and Multiple Sclerosis [MS] patients could lead us to discriminate toward them. For instance, U-fiber and Dawson's finger-type lesions are suggestive of MS, however linear ependymal lesions raise the possibility of NMOSD. Recently, artificial intelligence [AI] models have been used to discriminate between NMOSD and MS based on MRI features. In this study, we aim to systematically review the capability of AI algorithms in NMOSD and MS discrimination based on MRI features.
Method
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Embase, and IEEE databases up to August 2023. All studies that used AI-based algorithms to discriminate between NMOSD and MS using MRI features were included, without any restriction in time, region, race, and age. Data on NMOSD and MS patients, Aquaporin-4 antibodies [AQP4-Ab] status, diagnosis criteria, performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC), artificial intelligence paradigm, MR imaging, and used features were extracted. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023465265.
Results
Fifteen studies were included in this systematic review, with sample sizes ranging between 53 and 351. 1,362 MS patients and 1,118 NMOSD patients were included in our systematic review. AQP4-Ab was positive in 94.9% of NMOSD patients in 9 studies. Eight studies used machine learning [ML] as a classifier, while 7 used deep learning [DL]. AI models based on only MRI or MRI and clinical features yielded a pooled accuracy of 82% (95% CI: 78–86%), sensitivity of 83% (95% CI: 79–88%), and specificity of 80% (95% CI: 75–86%). In subgroup analysis, using only MRI features yielded an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83% (95% CI: 78–88%), 81% (95% CI: 76–87%), and 84% (95% CI: 79–89%), respectively.
Conclusion
AI models based on MRI features showed a high potential to discriminate between NMOSD and MS. However, heterogeneity in MR imaging, model evaluation, and reporting performance metrics, among other confounders, affected the reliability of our results. Well-designed studies on multicentric datasets, standardized imaging and evaluation protocols, and detailed transparent reporting of results are needed to reach optimal performance.}

abstract = {Background and Objective:
Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality among children under five, particularly in low-resource settings. Accurate differentiation between viral and bacterial pneumonia is essential for guiding appropriate treatment, yet it remains challenging due to overlapping clinical and radiographic features. Advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL), have shown promise in classifying pneumonia using chest X-ray (CXR) images. This scoping review summarises the evidence on ML techniques for classifying viral and bacterial pneumonia using CXR images in paediatric patients.
Methods:
This scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify studies involving children (0–18 years) with pneumonia diagnosed through CXR, using ML models for binary or multiclass classification. Data extraction included ML models, dataset characteristics, and performance metrics.
Results:
A total of 35 studies, published between 2018 and 2025, were included in this review. Of these, 31 studies used the publicly available Kermany dataset, raising concerns about overfitting and limited generalisability to broader, real-world clinical populations. Most studies (n=33) used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pneumonia classification. While many models demonstrated promising performance, significant variability was observed due to differences in methodologies, dataset sizes, and validation strategies, complicating direct comparisons. For binary classification (viral vs bacterial pneumonia), a median accuracy of 92.3% (range: 80.8% to 97.9%) was reported. For multiclass classification (healthy, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia), the median accuracy was 91.8% (range: 76.8% to 99.7%).
Conclusions:
Current evidence is constrained by a predominant reliance on a single dataset and variability in methodologies, which limit the generalisability and clinical applicability of findings. To address these limitations, future research should focus on developing diverse and representative datasets while adhering to standardised reporting guidelines. Such efforts are essential to improve the reliability, reproducibility, and translational potential of machine learning models in clinical settings.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an intractable problem that has the potential to significantly limit advances in human health. Recently, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Statement on AMR defined targets for addressing the impact of resistance on human, animal, and environmental health. For human health, the discovery and development of new antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship programmes, antimicrobial surveillance, and infection control and prevention are all key areas. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally placed to help achieve the UNGA targets via its role in revealing patterns in data that are clinically indiscernible, and using that information to build clinical decision support systems. However, significant barriers remain in terms of necessary infrastructure, know-how, and the implementation of AI approaches. In this Series paper, we consider the potential applications of AI in combatting the AMR problem through drug discovery and development, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostics, and surveillance, and their use in public health. We then discuss the technical, infrastructure, regulatory, ethical, and policy challenges that affect these domains.}

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) currently represents the fifth most common malignancy and the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with incidence and mortality rates that are increasing. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of HCC clinical care, by improving HCC risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognostication. AI approaches include computational search algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. ML consists of a computer running repeated iterations of models, in order to progressively improve performance of a specific task, such as classifying an outcome. DL models are a subtype of ML, based on neural network structures that are inspired by the neuroanatomy of the human brain. A growing body of recent data now apply DL models to diverse data sources – including electronic health record data, imaging modalities, histopathology and molecular biomarkers – to improve the accuracy of HCC risk prediction, detection and prediction of treatment response. Despite the promise of these early results, future research is still needed to standardise AI data, and to improve both the generalisability and interpretability of results. If such challenges can be overcome, AI has the potential to profoundly change the way in which care is provided to patients with or at risk of HCC.}

abstract = {Purpose
A growing number of studies have examined whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can support imaging-based diagnosis of COVID-19-caused pneumonia, including both gains in diagnostic performance and speed. However, what is currently missing is a combined appreciation of studies comparing human readers and AI.
Methods
We followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines for our systematic review, searching EMBASE, PUBMED and Scopus databases. To gain insights into the potential value of AI methods, we focused on studies comparing the performance of human readers versus AI models or versus AI-supported human readings.
Results
Our search identified 1270 studies, of which 12 fulfilled specific selection criteria. Concerning diagnostic performance, in testing datasets reported sensitivity was 42–100% (human readers, n = 9 studies), 60–95% (AI systems, n = 10) and 81–98% (AI-supported readers, n = 3), whilst reported specificity was 26–100% (human readers, n = 8), 61–96% (AI systems, n = 10) and 78–99% (AI-supported readings, n = 2). One study highlighted the potential of AI-supported readings for the assessment of lung lesion burden changes, whilst two studies indicated potential time savings for detection with AI.
Conclusions
Our review indicates that AI systems or AI-supported human readings show less performance variability (interquartile range) in general, and may support the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other forms of pneumonia when used in high-prevalence and symptomatic populations. However, inconsistencies related to study design, reporting of data, areas of risk of bias, as well as limitations of statistical analyses complicate clear conclusions. We therefore support efforts for developing critical elements of study design when assessing the value of AI for diagnostic imaging.}

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can realize multidimensional patient feature modeling through the deep semantic fusion of multimodal medical data, which can significantly improve the efficiency of disease identification and medical resource scheduling, and support the formulation of precise individual treatment strategies. In this paper, we systematically describe the development, applications, chanllenges and future of MLLMs in clinical practice and medical research, and provide a theoretical framework and practical guidelines for building a new generation of intelligent healthcare infrastructure. However, data silos, modality fusion strategies, computational resource requirements, and ethical compliance are still the main bottlenecks. Through this review, it is hoped that it can help more medical researchers to understand the progress of MLLMs technology, and help more medical researchers and MLLMs developers to work closely with each other through interdisciplinary cooperation, to create more products that are beneficial to the development of human health and put them into practical applications.}

The increase in cancer mortality rates is attributed to limitations in diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and therapeutic interventions. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are promising light-based systems used for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. They incorporate photosensitisers (PSs), light and oxygen to visualize or eradicate cancer cells. Even though nanotechnology has advanced these techniques, several limitations, such as target selectivity, PS dose, prognosis, poor light delivery, and inaccurate diagnosis, have hampered their overall efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focusses on predictions and automation, playing a pivotal role in expediting drug discovery and promoting precision in healthcare. AI algorithms have the potential to optimise the design of PSs for improved tissue penetration and affinity, enhancing target-selectivity via identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and optimising light delivery parameters for uniform light propagation in tissues. Therefore, this review highlights advancements in the integration of AI in PDD and PDT applications over the last decade, as well as a new perspective on how AI technology can improve PDD and PDT and continue to improve human health in the future.}

In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) about ML approaches to diagnose and classify brain tumors. We utilized the WHO classical classification to identify widely used and unique approaches in this field. In addition, we provide important topics and open topics.

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial Intelligence-based Medical Devices (AI-based MDs) are experiencing exponential growth in healthcare. This study aimed to investigate whether current studies assessing AI contain the information required for health technology assessment (HTA) by HTA bodies.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology to extract articles published between 2016 and 2021 related to the assessment of AI-based MDs. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, technology, algorithms, comparators, and results. AI quality assessment and HTA scores were calculated to evaluate whether the items present in the included studies were concordant with the HTA requirements. We performed a linear regression for the HTA and AI scores with the explanatory variables of the impact factor, publication date, and medical specialty. We conducted a univariate analysis of the HTA score and a multivariate analysis of the AI score with an alpha risk of 5 %.
Results
Of 5578 retrieved records, 56 were included. The mean AI quality assessment score was 67 %; 32 % of articles had an AI quality score ≥ 70 %, 50 % had a score between 50 % and 70 %, and 18 % had a score under 50 %. The highest quality scores were observed for the study design (82 %) and optimisation (69 %) categories, whereas the scores were lowest in the clinical practice category (23 %). The mean HTA score was 52 % for all seven domains. 100 % of the studies assessed clinical effectiveness, whereas only 9 % evaluated safety, and 20 % evaluated economic issues. There was a statistically significant relationship between the impact factor and the HTA and AI scores (both p = 0.046).
Discussion
Clinical studies on AI-based MDs have limitations and often lack adapted, robust, and complete evidence. High-quality datasets are also required because the output data can only be trusted if the inputs are reliable. The existing assessment frameworks are not specifically designed to assess AI-based MDs. From the perspective of regulatory authorities, we suggest that these frameworks should be adapted to assess the interpretability, explainability, cybersecurity, and safety of ongoing updates. From the perspective of HTA agencies, we highlight that transparency, professional and patient acceptance, ethical issues, and organizational changes are required for the implementation of these devices. Economic assessments of AI should rely on a robust methodology (business impact or health economic models) to provide decision-makers with more reliable evidence.
Conclusion
Currently, AI studies are insufficient to cover HTA prerequisites. HTA processes also need to be adapted because they do not consider the important specificities of AI-based MDs. Specific HTA workflows and accurate assessment tools should be designed to standardise evaluations, generate reliable evidence, and create confidence.}

The fact that lung cancer is still the most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally emphasizes how important early detection is to raising survival rates. Traditional low dose computed tomography (LDCT) focuses primarily on identifying lung malignancies, often missing the opportunity to detect other clinically relevant biomarkers. This review explores the expanding role of AI in radiology, where AI-driven algorithms can simultaneously detect multiple biomarkers and composite health measures, facilitating the opportunistic identification of conditions beyond lung cancer. These include musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary conditions, hepatic steatosis, and malignancies in the adrenal and thyroid glands, as well as breast tissue. Through an extensive review of current literature sourced from PubMed, the review highlights advancements in AI-driven biomarker detection, evaluates the potential benefits of a broader diagnostic approach, and addresses challenges related to model standardization and clinical integration. AI-enhanced LDCT screening shows significant promise in augmenting routine screenings, potentially advancing early detection, comprehensive patient assessments, and overall disease management across multiple health conditions.}

abstract = {Abstract:
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is still the most common infectious disease that kills people around the world. Drug-resistant types like multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) and widely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are becoming more common, which makes treatment much harder. Molecular tests and trait drug resistance testing are common ways to diagnose problems, but they take a long time to do or are hard to get to, especially in places with few resources. New developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer potential new ways to quickly and accurately profile drug resistance by using a variety of data sources.
Methods
In this study, Pretrained CNNs (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet) extracted CXR features, genomic mutations were modeled using transformer-based encoders, and clinical variables were encoded using dense layers. Modality-specific embeddings were fused using an attention-based architecture.
Results
The proposed model achieved 91.2% accuracy, 89.4% sensitivity, and 92.7% precision, outperforming single-modality baselines. Drug-specific AUC values exceeded 90% for isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Ablation studies confirmed substantial performance gains from tri-modal integration.
Conclusion
The results of this study show that using transfer learning along with multi-modal data merging can speed up and improve the identification of TB drug resistance. The framework provides an expandable, low-cost, and flexible way to help people make personalised treatment choices, even in places with limited testing tools. In the future, researchers will focus on adding to datasets and making sure they can be used in clinical settings by doing prospective studies.}

Around the globe, the total number of cases and deaths reported till November 12, 2022, were >600 million and 6.6 million, respectively. During the period of COVID-19, several diverse diagnostic techniques have been proposed. This work presents a systematic review of COVID-19 diagnostic techniques in response to such acts. Initially, these techniques are classified into different categories based on their working principle and detection modalities, i.e. chest X-ray imaging, cough sound or respiratory patterns, RT-PCR, antigen testing, and antibody testing. After that, a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate these techniques' efficacy which may help to determine an optimum solution for a particular scenario. The findings of the proposed work show that Artificial Intelligence plays a vital role in developing COVID-19 diagnostic techniques which support the healthcare system.

abstract = {Rationale and objectives
Deep learning (DL)–based methods show promise in detecting pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. This meta-analysis aimed to (1) determine pooled performance estimates of DL algorithms for PE detection; and (2) compare the diagnostic efficacy of convolutional neural network (CNN)– versus U-Net–based architectures.
Materials and methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed and EMBASE through April 15, 2025 for English‐language studies (2010–2025) reporting DL models for PE detection with extractable 2 × 2 data or performance metrics. True/false positives and negatives were reconstructed when necessary under an assumed 50 % PE prevalence (with 0.5 continuity correction). We approximated AUROC as the mean of sensitivity and specificity if not directly reported. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were pooled using a DerSimonian–Laird random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey transformation; AUROC values were combined via a fixed-effect inverse-variance approach. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q and I2. Subgroup analyses contrasted CNN versus U-Net models.
Results
Twenty-four studies (n = 22,984 patients) met inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates were: AUROC 0.895 (95 % CI: 0.874–0.917), sensitivity 0.894 (0.856–0.923), specificity 0.871 (0.831–0.903), accuracy 0.857 (0.833–0.882), PPV 0.832 (0.794–0.869) and NPV 0.902 (0.874–0.929). Between-study heterogeneity was high (I2 ≈ 97 % for sensitivity/specificity). U-Net models exhibited higher sensitivity (0.899 vs 0.893) and CNN models higher specificity (0.926 vs 0.900); subgroup Q‐tests confirmed significant differences for both sensitivity (p = 0.0002) and specificity (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
DL algorithms demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for PE detection on CTPA, with complementary strengths: U-Net architectures excel in true-positive identification, whereas CNNs yield fewer false positives. However, marked heterogeneity underscores the need for standardized, prospective validation before routine clinical implementation.}

There has been a surge of interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based medical devices. However, it is poorly understood how and which AI/ML-based medical devices have been approved in the USA and Europe. We searched governmental and non-governmental databases to identify 222 devices approved in the USA and 240 devices in Europe. The number of approved AI/ML-based devices has increased substantially since 2015, with many being approved for use in radiology. However, few were qualified as high-risk devices. Of the 124 AI/ML-based devices commonly approved in the USA and Europe, 80 were first approved in Europe. One possible reason for approval in Europe before the USA might be the potentially relatively less rigorous evaluation of medical devices in Europe. The substantial number of approved devices highlight the need to ensure rigorous regulation of these devices. Currently, there is no specific regulatory pathway for AI/ML-based medical devices in the USA or Europe. We recommend more transparency on how devices are regulated and approved to enable and improve public trust, efficacy, safety, and quality of AI/ML-based medical devices. A comprehensive, publicly accessible database with device details for Conformité Européene (CE)-marked medical devices in Europe and US Food and Drug Administration approved devices is needed.}

abstract = {Background:
Recent healthcare advancements highlight the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - and especially, among its subfields, Machine Learning (ML) - in enhancing Breast Cancer (BC) clinical care, leading to improved patient outcomes and increased radiologists’ efficiency. While medical imaging techniques have significantly contributed to BC detection and diagnosis, their synergy with AI algorithms has consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, reduced False Positives (FPs), and enabled personalized treatment strategies. Despite the burgeoning enthusiasm for leveraging AI for early and effective BC clinical care, its widespread integration into clinical practice is yet to be realized, and the evaluation of AI-based health technologies in terms of health and economic outcomes remains an ongoing endeavor.
Objectives:
This scoping review aims to investigate AI (and especially ML) applications that have been implemented and evaluated across diverse clinical tasks or decisions in breast imaging and to explore the current state of evidence concerning the assessment of AI-based technologies for BC clinical care within the context of Health Technology Assessment (HTA).
Methods:
We conducted a systematic literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist in PubMed and Scopus to identify relevant studies on AI (and particularly ML) applications in BC detection and diagnosis. We limited our search to studies published from January 2015 to October 2023. The Minimum Information about CLinical Artificial Intelligence Modeling (MI-CLAIM) checklist was used to assess the quality of AI algorithms development, evaluation, and reporting quality in the reviewed articles. The HTA Core Model® was also used to analyze the comprehensiveness, robustness, and reliability of the reported results and evidence in AI-systems’ evaluations to ensure rigorous assessment of AI systems’ utility and cost-effectiveness in clinical practice.
Results:
Of the 1652 initially identified articles, 104 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. Most studies examined the clinical effectiveness of AI-based systems (78.84%, n= 82), with one study focusing on safety in clinical settings, and 13.46% (n=14) focusing on patients’ benefits. Of the studies, 31.73% (n=33) were ethically approved to be carried out in clinical practice, whereas 25% (n=26) evaluated AI systems legally approved for clinical use. Notably, none of the studies addressed the organizational implications of AI systems in clinical practice. Of the 104 studies, only two of them focused on cost-effectiveness analysis, and were analyzed separately. The average percentage scores for the first 102 AI-based studies’ quality assessment based on the MI-CLAIM checklist criteria were 84.12%, 83.92%, 83.98%, 74.51%, and 14.7% for study design, data and optimization, model performance, model examination, and reproducibility, respectively. Notably, 20.59% (n=21) of these studies relied on large-scale representative real-world breast screening datasets, with only 10.78% (n =11) studies demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the evaluated AI systems.
Conclusion:
In bridging the gap between cutting-edge developments and seamless integration of AI systems into clinical workflows, persistent challenges encompass data quality and availability, ethical and legal considerations, robustness and trustworthiness, scalability, and alignment with existing radiologists’ workflow. These hurdles impede the synthesis of comprehensive, robust, and reliable evidence to substantiate these systems’ clinical utility, relevance, and cost-effectiveness in real-world clinical workflows. Consequently, evaluating AI-based health technologies through established HTA methodologies becomes complicated. We also highlight potential significant influences on AI systems’ effectiveness of various factors, such as operational dynamics, organizational structure, the application context of AI systems, and practices in breast screening or examination reading of AI support tools in radiology. Furthermore, we emphasize substantial reciprocal influences on decision-making processes between AI systems and radiologists. Thus, we advocate for an adapted assessment framework specifically designed to address these potential influences on AI systems’ effectiveness, mainly addressing system-level transformative implications for AI systems rather than focusing solely on technical performance and task-level evaluations.}

abstract = {Context
Men suspected of harboring prostate cancer (PCa) increasingly undergo multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and mpMRI-guided biopsy. The potential of mpMRI coupled to artificial intelligence (AI) methods to detect and classify PCa before decision-making requires investigation.
Objective
To review the literature for studies addressing the diagnostic performance of combined mpMRI and AI approaches to detect and classify PCa, and to provide selection criteria for relevant articles having clinical significance.
Evidence acquisition
We performed a nonsystematic search of the English language literature using the PubMed-MEDLINE database up to October 30, 2020. We included all original studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI and AI to detect and classify PCa with histopathological analysis as a reference standard.
Evidence synthesis
Eleven studies assessed AI and mpMRI approaches for PCa detection and classification based on a ground truth that referred to the entire prostate either with radical prostatectomy specimens (RPS) or relocalization of positive systematic and/or targeted biopsy. Seven studies retrospectively annotated cancerous lesions onto mpMRI identified in whole-mount sections from RPS, three studies used a backward projection of histological prostate biopsy information, and one study used a combined cohort of both approaches. All studies cross-validated their data sets; only four used a test set and one a multisite validation scheme. Performance metrics for lesion detection ranged from 87.9% to 92% at a threshold specificity of 50%. The lesion classification accuracy of the algorithms was comparable to that of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System.
Conclusions
For an algorithm to be implemented into radiological workflows and to be clinically applicable, it must be trained with a ground truth labeling that reflects histopathological information for the entire prostate and it must be externally validated. Lesion detection and classification performance metrics are promising but require prospective implementation and external validation for clinical significance.
Patient summary
We reviewed the literature for studies on prostate cancer detection and classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and artificial intelligence algorithms. The main application is in supporting radiologists in interpreting MRI scans and improving the diagnostic performance, so that fewer unnecessary biopsies are carried out.}

Cardiovascular AI achieves high accuracy in diagnostic support and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, it can even detect abnormalities that were previously difficult for cardiologists to detect. Randomized controlled trials begin to be reported to verify the usefulness of cardiovascular AI. The day is approaching when cardiovascular AI will be commonly used in clinical practice. Various types of medical AI will be used for cardiovascular care; however, it will not replace medical doctors.

Compared to previous review articles on the topic, this study pigeon-holes the collected literature very differently (i.e., its multi-level arrangement). For this purpose, 71 relevant studies were found using a variety of trustworthy databases and search engines, including Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus. We classify the selected literature in multi-level machine learning groups, such as supervised and weakly supervised learning. Our review article reveals that weak supervision has been adopted extensively for COVID-19 CT diagnosis compared to supervised learning. Weakly supervised (conventional transfer learning) techniques can be utilized effectively for real-time clinical practices by reusing the sophisticated features rather than over-parameterizing the standard models. Few-shot and self-supervised learning are the recent trends to address data scarcity and model efficacy. The deep learning (artificial intelligence) based models are mainly utilized for disease management and control.

Although several studies have compared the performance of deep learning (DL) models and radiologists for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT of the chest, these results have not been collectively evaluated. We performed a meta-analysis of original articles comparing the performance of DL models versus radiologists in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted on the three main medical literature databases, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, for articles published as of February 1st, 2023. We included original scientific articles that compared DL models trained to detect COVID-19 pneumonia on CT to radiologists. Meta-analysis was performed to determine DL versus radiologist performance in terms of model sensitivity and specificity, taking into account inter and intra-study heterogeneity.
Results
Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. Based on the meta-analytic calculations, DL models had significantly higher pooled sensitivity (0.933 vs. 0.829, p < 0.001) compared to radiologists with similar pooled specificity (0.905 vs. 0.897, p = 0.746). In the differentiation of COVID-19 versus community-acquired pneumonia, the DL models had significantly higher sensitivity compared to radiologists (0.915 vs. 0.836, p = 0.001).
Conclusions
DL models have high performance for screening of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT, offering the possibility of these models for augmenting radiologists in clinical practice.}

Our survey also offers insights into the role that imaging can play in the treatment of comorbid patients, based on probabilities derived from COVID-19 symptom statistics. Such symptoms include myocardial injury, hypoxia, plaque rupture, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, coronary thrombosis, encephalitis, ischemia, inflammation, and lung injury. At its core, this study considers the role of image-based AI, which can be used to characterize the tissues of a COVID-19 patient and classify the severity of their infection.

Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.}

For AI to succeed in modern clinical practice, model training and algorithm development need to account for relevant background information that may influence the presentation of the patient in question. While AI is often remarkably accurate in distinguishing binary outcomes–hemorrhage vs. no hemorrhage; fracture vs. no fracture–the narrow scope of current training datasets prevents AI from examining the entire clinical context of the image in question.

Clinical symptoms of PD are slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that is created to work in the way of a “human brain” using many intertwined neurons to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, to assess the severity of the patient’s condition.

Background
Despite growing interest, artificial intelligence (AI) applications in shoulder and elbow surgery remain underdeveloped. While adoption is accelerating and shows promise in addressing complex clinical problems, substantial technical and clinical barriers persist. Collaborative research may be relevant for generating high-quality datasets and more robust, generalizable, and clinically relevant algorithms. This study aimed to 1) analyze trends in AI research productivity and impact, 2) map collaboration patterns among affiliations and regions, and 3) assess the relationship between affiliation-based collaboration and research outcomes.
Methods
We conducted a bibliometric analysis of Scopus-indexed articles published between January 2000 and November 2024, focusing on peer-reviewed studies involving AI applications in shoulder or elbow surgery. Data collected included number of publications, citation metrics, author affiliations, and index keywords. These variables were used to calculate composite metrics and to examine the geographic distribution of research and collaboration patterns using network analysis. Two linear regression models assessed the relationship between affiliation-based collaborations and publication volume and citation impact.
Results
Of 181 identified scholarly documents, 119 met eligibility criteria. These articles were published across 63 journals and cited a total of 1,519 times. The Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery contributed the highest number of articles (n = 20), while Acta Orthopaedica had the highest average citations per article (n = 310), although in a single article. The annual publication rate increased rapidly after 2014, peaking at 49 in 2024. A small group of affiliations disproportionately influenced output and citations. Collaboration networks were sparse (density 0.03) yet showed distinct geographic clusters. Most research output originated from the United States (48%), followed by South Korea (12%) and China (8%). A total of 1,010 collaborations were identified among 260 affiliations. The network showed low density (0.03) but high modularity (0.81), indicating sparse overall connectivity yet tightly clustered communities. Regression models indicated that each additional collaboration established between affiliations was associated with 5 more publications (R2 = 1.0) and increased average citations per article by 0.2 (R2 = 0.77).
Conclusion
Affiliation-based collaboration was strongly associated with both the volume and citation impact of AI research in shoulder and elbow surgery. Strengthening and expanding these networks may enhance global research participation, foster innovation, and improve the clinical applicability of future work.}

Each of these methods contributes unique diagnostic insights, enhancing the overall assessment of patient condition. Nevertheless, the amalgamation of data from multiple modalities presents difficulties due to disparities in resolution, data collection methods, and noise levels. While traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in single-modality tasks, they struggle to handle multi-modal complexities, lacking the capacity to model global relationships. This research presents a novel approach for examining multi-modal medical imagery using a transformer-based system. The framework employs self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to synchronize and integrate features across various modalities. Additionally, it shows resilience to variations in noise and image quality, making it adaptable for real-time clinical use. To address the computational hurdles linked to transformer models, particularly in real-time clinical applications in resource-constrained environments, several optimization techniques have been integrated to boost scalability and efficiency. Initially, a streamlined transformer architecture was adopted to minimize the computational load while maintaining model effectiveness. Methods such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been applied to reduce the parameter count and enhance the inference speed. Furthermore, efficient attention mechanisms such as linear or sparse attention were employed to alleviate the substantial memory and processing requirements of traditional self-attention operations. For further deployment optimization, researchers have implemented hardware-aware acceleration strategies, including the use of TensorRT and ONNX-based model compression, to ensure efficient execution on edge devices. These optimizations allow the approach to function effectively in real-time clinical settings, ensuring viability even in environments with limited resources. Future research directions include integrating non-imaging data to facilitate personalized treatment and enhancing computational efficiency for implementation in resource-limited environments. This study highlights the transformative potential of transformer models in multi-modal medical imaging, offering improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient care outcomes.}

This scoping review examines the landscape of deep learning-based multimodal AI applications across the medical domain, analyzing 432 papers published between 2018 and 2024. We provide an extensive overview of multimodal AI development across different medical disciplines, examining various architectural approaches, fusion strategies, and common application areas. Our analysis reveals that multimodal AI models consistently outperform their unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2 percentage points in AUC. However, several challenges persist, including cross-departmental coordination, heterogeneous data characteristics, and incomplete datasets. We critically assess the technical and practical challenges in developing multimodal AI systems and discuss potential strategies for their clinical implementation, including a brief overview of commercially available multimodal AI models for clinical decision-making. Additionally, we identify key factors driving multimodal AI development and propose recommendations to accelerate the field’s maturation. This review provides researchers and clinicians with a thorough understanding of the current state, challenges, and future directions of multimodal AI in medicine.}

The lack of standardization hinders clinical interoperability, collaborative research, and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models that depend on large, high-quality datasets. The Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard offers a robust solution for ensuring interoperability in medical imaging. Although DICOM is widely utilized in radiology and cardiology, its adoption in ophthalmology remains limited. Retinal imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus photography, and OCT angiography (OCTA) have revolutionized retinal disease management but are constrained by proprietary and non-standardized formats. This review underscores the necessity for harmonized imaging standards in ophthalmology, detailing DICOM standards for retinal imaging including ophthalmic photography (OP), OCT, and OCTA, and their requisite metadata information. Additionally, the potential of DICOM standardization for advancing AI applications in ophthalmology is explored. A notable example is the Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) dataset, the first publicly available standards-compliant DICOM retinal imaging dataset. This dataset encompasses diverse retinal imaging modalities, including color fundus photography, infrared, autofluorescence, OCT, and OCTA. By leveraging multimodal retinal imaging, AI-READI provides a transformative resource for studying diabetes and its complications, setting a blueprint for future datasets aimed at harmonizing imaging formats and enabling AI-driven breakthroughs in ophthalmology. Our manuscript also addresses challenges in retinal imaging for diabetic patients, retinal imaging-based AI applications for studying diabetes, and potential advancements in retinal imaging standardization.}

abstract = {Colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. These polyps must be found and treated as soon as possible to avoid developing CRC. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL), has markedly improved the early diagnosis and treatment of CRC by increasing the accuracy and efficiency of polyp identification and classification. However, the rapid growth of research in this area has created a fragmented environment, highlighting the need for a comprehensive synthesis of findings to guide future advancements. This review aims to address this gap by systematically analyzing the state-of-the-art DL methodologies applied to colorectal polyp analysis. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a structured search of major databases, identifying and analyzing 160 papers published between 2017 and 2024. The review focuses on the architectures of DL models, publicly available datasets, and performance metrics. The authors have analysed a wide range of DL architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), YOLO-based object detectors, transformer models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), autoencoders, and hybrid systems. Notably, YOLOv4 and CA-ResNet50 displayed state-of-the-art detection performance with accuracy rates exceeding 99 % on benchmark datasets such as LC25000 and Kvasir-SEG. For segmentation tasks, transformer-enhanced models like ViT and SwinE-Net earned excellent Dice scores (>0.92), beating standard UNet variations. However, the research also reveals persisting problems, such as dataset variability, low generalizability across diverse populations, and the absence of standardized benchmarking techniques. In addition, we critically investigate the significance of data augmentation strategies in reducing dataset limits and overfitting, and also analyze how dataset characteristics affect model performance. Finally, structured future recommendations have been provided across three critical dimensions: (1) designing comprehensive and diverse datasets to improve generalizability, (2) establishing standardized and task-specific data augmentation pipelines, and (3) developing hybrid and modular architectures optimized for specific diagnostic subtasks. This thorough analysis aims to clarify the present status of research and highlight possibilities for enhancement in this vital healthcare sector.}

Convolutive neural networks were inspired from the visual cortex; they process combinations of information used in image or voice recognition. Deep learning (DL) groups together a set of ML methods and is useful for modeling complex relationships with a high degree of abstraction by using multiple layers of artificial neurons. ML techniques have a growing role in spine surgery. The main applications are the segmentation of intraoperative images for surgical navigation or robotics used for pedicle screw placement, the interpretation of images of intervertebral discs or full spine radiographs, which can be automated using ML algorithms. ML techniques can also be used as aids for surgical decision-making in complex fields, such as preoperative evaluation of adult spinal deformity. ML algorithms “learn” from large clinical databases. They make it possible to establish the intraoperative risk level and make a prognosis on how the postoperative functional scores will change over time as a function of the patient profile. These applications open a new path relative to standard statistical analyses. They make it possible to explore more complex relationships with multiple indirect interactions. In the future, AI algorithms could have a greater role in clinical research, evaluating clinical and surgical practices, and conducting health economics analyses.}

Defined as the extraction and analysis of a large number of quantitative parameters from medical images, radiomics is an evolving field in precision medicine with the ultimate goal of the discovery of new imaging biomarkers for disease. Radiomics has already shown promising results in extracting diagnostic, prognostic, and molecular information latent in medical images. After acquisition of the medical images as part of the standard of care, a region of interest is defined often via a manual or semi-automatic approach. An algorithm then extracts and computes quantitative radiomics parameters from the region of interest. Whereas radiomics captures quantitative values of shape and texture based on predefined mathematical terms, neural networks have recently been used to directly learn and identify predictive features from medical images. Thereby, neural networks largely forego the need for so called “hand-engineered” features, which appears to result in significantly improved performance and reliability. Opportunities for radiomics and neural networks in pediatric nuclear medicine/radiology/molecular imaging are broad and can be thought of in three categories: automating well-defined administrative or clinical tasks, augmenting broader administrative or clinical tasks, and unlocking new methods of generating value. Specific applications include intelligent order sets, automated protocoling, improved image acquisition, computer aided triage and detection of abnormalities, next generation voice dictation systems, biomarker development, and therapy planning.}

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most incapacitating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). PD is the second most common NDD worldwide which affects approximately 1–2 percent of people over 65 years. It is an attractive pursuit for artificial intelligence (AI) to contribute to and evolve PD treatments through drug repositioning by repurposing existing drugs, shelved drugs, or even candidates that do not meet the criteria for clinical trials. A search was conducted in three databases Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We reviewed the data related to the last years (1975-present) to identify those drugs currently being proposed for repositioning in PD. Moreover, we reviewed the present status of the computational approach, including AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementation in PD treatment. It was found that the number of drug repositioning studies for PD has increased recently. Repositioning of drugs in PD is taking off, and scientific communities are increasingly interested in communicating its results and finding effective treatment alternatives for PD. A better chance of success in PD drug discovery has been made possible due to AI/ML algorithm advancements. In addition to the experimentation stage of drug discovery, it is also important to leverage AI in the planning stage of clinical trials to make them more effective. New AI-based models or solutions that increase the success rate of drug development are greatly needed.}

abstract = {This narrative review explores the ethical, legal, and regulatory landscape of AI integration in Australian healthcare, focusing on radiography. It examines the current legislative framework, assesses the trust and reliability of AI tools, and proposes future directions for ethical AI integration in radiography. AI systems significantly enhance diagnostic radiography by improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in stroke detection, brain imaging, and chest reporting. However, AI raises substantial ethical concerns due to its 'black-box' nature and potential biases in training data. The Therapeutic Goods Administration's reforms in Australia, though comprehensive, fall short of fully addressing issues related to the trustworthiness and legal liabilities of AI tools. Adopting a comprehensive research strategy that includes doctrinal, comparative, and public policy analyses will facilitate an understanding of international practices, particularly from countries with similar legal systems, and help guide Australia in refining its regulatory framework. For an ethical future in radiography, a robust, multi-disciplinary approach is required to prioritize patient safety, data privacy, and equitable AI use. A framework that balances technological innovation with ethical and legal integrity is essential for advancing healthcare while preserving trust and transparency. Healthcare professionals, policymakers, and AI developers must collaborate to establish a resilient, equitable, and transparent healthcare system. Future research should focus on multi-disciplinary methodologies, combining doctrinal, comparative, and public policy research to provide comprehensive insights. This approach will guide Australia in creating a more inclusive and ethically sound legal framework for AI in healthcare, ensuring its ethical and beneficial integration into radiography.
RÉSUMÉ
Cette étude narrative explore le paysage éthique, juridique et réglementaire de l'intégration de l'IA dans les soins de santé en Australie, en se concentrant sur la radiographie. Elle examine le cadre législatif actuel, évalue la confiance et la fiabilité des outils d'IA et propose des orientations futures pour l'intégration éthique de l'IA dans la radiographie. Les systèmes d'IA améliorent considérablement le diagnostic radiographique en améliorant la précision et l'efficacité du diagnostic dans la détection des accidents vasculaires cérébraux, l'imagerie cérébrale et les rapports sur le thorax. Toutefois, l'IA soulève d'importantes questions éthiques en raison de sa nature « boîte noire » et des biais potentiels dans les données d'apprentissage. Les réformes de la Therapeutic Goods Administration en Australie, bien que complètes, ne répondent pas entièrement aux questions liées à la fiabilité et aux responsabilités juridiques des outils d'IA. L'adoption d'une stratégie de recherche globale comprenant des analyses doctrinales, comparatives et de politique publique facilitera la compréhension des pratiques internationales, en particulier celles des pays dotés de systèmes juridiques similaires, et aidera à guider l'Australie dans l'affinement de son cadre réglementaire. Pour assurer un avenir éthique à la radiographie, une approche solide et multidisciplinaire est nécessaire pour donner la priorité à la sécurité des patients, à la confidentialité des données et à l'utilisation équitable de l'IA. Un cadre qui équilibre l'innovation technologique avec l'intégrité éthique et juridique est essentiel pour faire progresser les soins de santé tout en préservant la confiance et la transparence. Les professionnels de la santé, les décideurs politiques et les développeurs d'IA doivent collaborer pour mettre en place un système de santé résilient, équitable et transparent. Les recherches futures devraient se concentrer sur des méthodologies multidisciplinaires, combinant la recherche doctrinale, comparative et sur les politiques publiques afin de fournir des perspectives complètes. Cette approche guidera l'Australie dans la création d'un cadre juridique plus inclusif et éthique pour l'IA dans les soins de santé, garantissant son intégration éthique et bénéfique dans la radiographie.}

Background
The field of precision medicine endeavors to transform the healthcare industry by advancing individualised strategies for diagnosis, treatment modalities, and predictive assessments. This is achieved by utilizing extensive multidimensional biological datasets encompassing diverse components, such as an individual's genetic makeup, functional attributes, and environmental influences. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, namely machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have exhibited remarkable efficacy in predicting the potential occurrence of specific cancers and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive scoping review guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework. Our search strategy involved combining key terms related to CVD and AI using the Boolean operator AND. In August 2023, we conducted an extensive search across reputable scholarly databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and arXiv to gather relevant academic literature on personalised medicine for CVD. Subsequently, in January 2024, we extended our search to include internet search engines such as Google and various CVD websites. These searches were further updated in March 2024. Additionally, we reviewed the reference lists of the final selected research articles to identify any additional relevant literature.
Findings
A total of 2307 records were identified during the process of conducting the study, consisting of 564 entries from external sites like arXiv and 1743 records found through database searching. After 430 duplicate articles were eliminated, 1877 items that remained were screened for relevancy. In this stage, 1241 articles remained for additional review after 158 irrelevant articles and 478 articles with insufficient data were removed. 355 articles were eliminated for being inaccessible, 726 for being written in a language other than English, and 281 for not having undergone peer review. Consequently, 121 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis. At the intersection of CVD, AI, and precision medicine, we found important scientific findings in our scoping review. Intricate pattern extraction from large, complicated genetic datasets is a skill that AI algorithms excel at, allowing for accurate disease diagnosis and CVD risk prediction. Furthermore, these investigations have uncovered unique genetic biomarkers linked to CVD, providing insight into the workings of the disease and possible treatment avenues. The construction of more precise predictive models and personalised treatment plans based on the genetic profiles of individual patients has been made possible by the revolutionary advancement of CVD risk assessment through the integration of AI and genomics.
Interpretation
The systematic methodology employed ensured the thorough examination of available literature and the inclusion of relevant studies, contributing to the robustness and reliability of the study's findings. Our analysis stresses a crucial point in terms of the adaptability and versatility of AI solutions. AI algorithms designed in non-CVD domains such as in oncology, often include ideas and tactics that might be modified to address cardiovascular problems.

Traditional CAD systems in mammography screening have followed a rules-based approach, incorporating domain knowledge into hand-crafted features before using classical machine learning techniques as a classifier. The first commercial CAD system, ImageChecker M1000, relies on computer vision techniques for pattern recognition. Unfortunately, CAD systems have been shown to adversely affect some radiologists' performance and increase recall rates. The Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge was a multidisciplinary collaboration that provided 640,000 mammography images for teams to help decrease false-positive rates in breast cancer screening. Winning solutions leveraged deep learning's (DL) automatic hierarchical feature learning capabilities and used convolutional neural networks. Start-ups Therapixel and Kheiron Medical Technologies are using DL for breast cancer screening. With increasing use of digital breast tomosynthesis, specific artificial intelligence (AI)-CAD systems are emerging to include iCAD's PowerLook Tomo Detection and ScreenPoint Medical's Transpara. Other AI-CAD systems are focusing on breast diagnostic techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is a gap in the market for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography AI-CAD tools. Clinical implementation of AI-CAD tools requires testing in scenarios mimicking real life to prove its usefulness in the clinical environment. This requires a large and representative dataset for testing and assessment of the reader's interaction with the tools. A cost-effectiveness assessment should be undertaken, with a large feasibility study carried out to ensure there are no unintended consequences. AI-CAD systems should incorporate explainable AI in accordance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).}

abstract = {Background/Aim
Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a relatively novel imaging technique that enables both anatomical and functional breast imaging, with improved diagnostic performance compared to standard 2D mammography. The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature on deep learning (DL) applications for CEM, exploring how these models can further enhance CEM diagnostic potential.
Methods
This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. We searched for studies published up to April 2024. MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar were used as search databases. Two reviewers independently implemented the search strategy. We included all types of original studies published in English that evaluated DL algorithms for automatic analysis of contrast-enhanced mammography CEM images. The quality of the studies was independently evaluated by two reviewers based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria.
Results
Sixteen relevant studies published between 2018 and 2024 were identified. All but one used convolutional neural network models (CNN) models. All studies evaluated DL algorithms for lesion classification, while six studies also assessed lesion detection or segmentation. Segmentation was performed manually in three studies, both manually and automatically in two studies and automatically in ten studies. For lesion classification on retrospective datasets, CNN models reported varied areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.53 to 0.99. Models incorporating attention mechanism achieved accuracies of 88.1% and 89.1%. Prospective studies reported AUC values of 0.89 and 0.91. Some studies demonstrated that combining DL models with radiomics featured improved classification. Integrating DL algorithms with radiologists’ assessments enhanced diagnostic performance.
Conclusion
While still at an early research stage, DL can improve CEM diagnostic precision. However, there is a relatively small number of studies evaluating different DL algorithms, and most studies are retrospective. Further prospective testing to assess performance of applications at actual clinical setting is warranted.}

abstract = {The practice of oncology requires analyzing and synthesizing abundant data. From the patient's workup to determine eligibility to the therapies received to the post-treatment surveillance, practitioners must constantly juggle, evaluate, and weigh decision-making based on their best understanding of information at hand. These complex, multifactorial decisions have a tremendous opportunity to benefit from data-driven machine learning (ML) methods to drive opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Within the past 5 years, we have seen AI move from simply a promising opportunity to being used in prospective trials. Here, we review recent efforts of AI in clinical trials that have moved the needle towards improved prediction of actionable outcomes, such as predicting acute care visits, short term mortality, and pathologic extranodal extension. We then pause and reflect on how these AI models ask a different question than traditional statistics models that readers may be more familiar with; how then should readers conceptualize and interpret AI models that they are not as familiar with. We end with what we believe are promising future opportunities for AI in oncology, with an eye towards allowing the data to inform us through unsupervised learning and generative models, rather than asking AI to perform specific functions.}

Advancement in technology has paved the way for analysis of big datasets in a cost- and time-effective manner. Clinical oncology and research are reaping the benefits of AI. The burden of cancer is a global phenomenon. Efforts to reduce mortality rates requires early diagnosis for effective therapeutic interventions. However, metastatic and recurrent cancers evolve and acquire drug resistance. It is imperative to detect novel biomarkers that induce drug resistance and identify therapeutic targets to enhance treatment regimes. The introduction of the next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms address these demands, has revolutionised the future of precision oncology. NGS offers several clinical applications that are important for risk predictor, early detection of disease, diagnosis by sequencing and medical imaging, accurate prognosis, biomarker identification and identification of therapeutic targets for novel drug discovery. NGS generates large datasets that demand specialised bioinformatics resources to analyse the data that is relevant and clinically significant. Through these applications of AI, cancer diagnostics and prognostic prediction are enhanced with NGS and medical imaging that delivers high resolution images. Regardless of the improvements in technology, AI has some challenges and limitations, and the clinical application of NGS remains to be validated. By continuing to enhance the progression of innovation and technology, the future of AI and precision oncology show great promise.}

In the recent years, the growth of deep learning, a successful technique for computer vision tasks that does not require explicit programming, coupled with the availability of large imaging databases fostered the development of multiple applications in the medical imaging field, especially for lung nodules and lung cancer, mostly through convolutional neural networks (CNN). Some of the first applications of AI is this field were dedicated to automated detection of lung nodules on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations, with performances now reaching or exceeding those of radiologists. For lung nodule segmentation, CNN-based algorithms applied to CT images show excellent spatial overlap index with manual segmentation, even for irregular and ground glass nodules. A third application of AI is the classification of lung nodules between malignant and benign, which could limit the number of follow-up CT examinations for less suspicious lesions. Several algorithms have demonstrated excellent capabilities for the prediction of the malignancy risk when a nodule is discovered. These different applications of AI for lung nodules are particularly appealing in the context of lung cancer screening. In the field of lung cancer, AI tools applied to lung imaging have been investigated for distinct aims. First, they could play a role for the non-invasive characterization of tumors, especially for histological subtype and somatic mutation predictions, with a potential therapeutic impact. Additionally, they could help predict the patient prognosis, in combination to clinical data. Despite these encouraging perspectives, clinical implementation of AI tools is only beginning because of the lack of generalizability of published studies, of an inner obscure working and because of limited data about the impact of such tools on the radiologists’ decision and on the patient outcome. Radiologists must be active participants in the process of evaluating AI tools, as such tools could support their daily work and offer them more time for high added value tasks.}

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous machine and deep learning (MDL) methods have been proposed in the literature to analyze patient physiological data. The objective of this review is to summarize various aspects of these methods and assess their practical utility for predicting various clinical outcomes.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, screened and selected the studies matching the inclusion criteria. The clinical analysis focused on the characteristics of the patient cohorts in the studies included in this review, the specific tasks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that machine and deep learning methods were used for, and their practical limitations. The technical analysis focused on the details of specific MDL methods and their performance.
Results
Analysis of the 48 selected studies revealed that the majority (∼54 %) of them examined the application of MDL methods for the prediction of survival/mortality-related patient outcomes, while a smaller fraction (∼13 %) of studies also examined applications to the prediction of patients’ physiological outcomes and hospital resource utilization. 21 % of the studies examined the application of MDL methods to multiple clinical tasks. Machine and deep learning methods have been shown to be effective at predicting several outcomes of COVID-19 patients, such as disease severity, complications, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and mortality. MDL methods also achieved high accuracy in predicting the required number of ICU beds and ventilators.
Conclusion
Machine and deep learning methods have been shown to be valuable tools for predicting disease severity, organ dysfunction and failure, patient outcomes, and hospital resource utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The discovered knowledge and our conclusions and recommendations can also be useful to healthcare professionals and artificial intelligence researchers in managing future pandemics.}

The other reasons for surge in research activities in this direction are advent of robust AI algorithms (deep learning), availability of hardware that can run/train those robust and complex AI algorithms and accessibility of large enough dataset required for training AI algorithms. Different imaging modalities that have been exploited by researchers to automate the task of breast cancer detection are mammograms, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathological images or any combination of them. This article analyzes these imaging modalities and presents their strengths and limitations. It also enlists resources from where their datasets can be accessed for research purpose. This article then summarizes AI and computer vision based state-of-the-art methods proposed in the last decade to detect breast cancer using various imaging modalities. Primarily, in this article we have focused on reviewing frameworks that have reported results using mammograms as it is the most widely used breast imaging modality that serves as the first test that medical practitioners usually prescribe for the detection of breast cancer. Another reason for focusing on mammogram imaging modalities is the availability of its labelled datasets. Datasets availability is one of the most important aspects for the development of AI based frameworks as such algorithms are data hungry and generally quality of dataset affects performance of AI based algorithms. In a nutshell, this research article will act as a primary resource for the research community working in the field of automated breast imaging analysis.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have made significant strides in image recognition and classification, providing remarkable diagnostic accuracy to various diseases. This domain of AI has been the focus of many research papers as it directly relates to the roles and responsibilities of a radiologist. However, discussions on the impact of such technology on the radiography profession are often overlooked. To address this gap in the literature, this paper aims to address the application of AI in radiography and how AI's rapid emergence into healthcare is impacting not only standard radiographic protocols but the role of the radiographic technologist as well.
Methods
A review of the literature on AI and radiography was performed, using databases within PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Video presentations from YouTube were also utilized to weigh the varying opinions of world leaders at the fore of artificial intelligence.
Results
AI can augment routine standard radiographic protocols. It can automatically ensure optimal patient positioning within the gantry as well as automate image processing. As AI technologies continue to emerge in diagnostic imaging, practicing radiologic technologists are urged to achieve threshold computational and technical literacy to operate AI-driven imaging technology.
Conclusion
There are many applications of AI in radiography including acquisition and image processing. In the near future, it will be important to supply the demand for radiographers skilled in AI-driven technologies.

Osteoporotic fractures are a major health challenge in older adults. Despite the availability of safe and effective therapies for osteoporosis, these therapies are underused in individuals at high risk for fracture, calling for better case-finding and fracture risk assessment strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) hold promise for enhancing identification of individuals at high risk for fracture by distilling useful features from high-dimensional data derived from medical records, imaging, and wearable devices. AI–ML could enable automated opportunistic screening for vertebral fractures and osteoporosis, home-based monitoring and intervention targeting lifestyle factors, and integration of multimodal features to leverage fracture prediction, ultimately aiding improved fracture risk assessment and individualised treatment. Optimism must be balanced with consideration for the explainability of AI–ML models, biases (including information inequity in numerically under-represented populations), model limitations, and net clinical benefit and workload impact. Clinical integration of AI–ML algorithms has the potential to transform osteoporosis management, offering a more personalised approach to reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}

Only seven studies related to patient and public views were retrieved, suggesting that this is an underexplored area of research. Two broad themes, of confidence in the capabilities of AI, and the accountability and transparency of AI, were identified.
Conclusions
Both optimism and concerns were expressed by participants. Transparency in the implementation of AI, scientific validation, clear regulation and accountability were expected. Combined human and AI interpretation of imaging was strongly favoured over AI acting autonomously. The review highlights the limited engagement of the public in the adoption of AI in a radiology setting.

The digital nature of radiological data and standardized data formats positioned radiology as the ideal testing ground for clinical AI integration. While initial enthusiasm led to inflated expectations, fueled by linear thinking and the planning fallacy, AI has now matured into tools that augment, rather than replace, radiologists’ expertise. Radiologists’ role is evolving from image interpreters to diagnostic orchestrators in a multimodal era. The integration of imaging data with diverse sources such as genomics, pathology, and wearable sensors necessitates a shift to a systems-level perspective. This transformation demands not only technical literacy but also interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively synthesize AI-driven insights and mitigate cognitive overload. Radiologists must navigate uncertainty, adopt structured workflows, and communicate AI-supported findings clearly to maintain trust in diagnostics. The emergence of generative AI, particularly large language models, further streamlines AI adoption by enabling intuitive, human-centered interfaces. However, addressing the growing knowledge gap is crucial. Traditional radiology training must be overhauled to incorporate data science, bioinformatics, and systems biology, ensuring radiologists are prepared to lead multimodal diagnostics. Radiologists are uniquely positioned to spearhead this transition, leveraging AI to integrate diverse data streams, improve patient care, and foster collaboration across specialties. Proactive adaptation will secure radiologists’ central role in AI-driven medicine, safeguarding the human element in healthcare while advancing diagnostic precision.}

In recent years, the advent of machine learning techniques has yielded satisfactory results in intelligent gland cancer diagnosis based on clinical images, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical image interpretation while reducing the workload of doctors. The focus of this study is to review, classify, and analyze intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning and deep learning. This paper briefly introduces some basic imaging principles of multimodal medical images, such as the commonly used computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), and pathology. In addition, the intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer were further classified into supervised learning and weakly supervised learning. Supervised learning consists of traditional machine learning methods, such as Knearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron, and deep learning methods evolving from convolutional neural network (CNN). By contrast, weakly supervised learning can be further categorized into active learning, semisupervised learning, and transfer learning. State-of-the-art methods are illustrated with implementation details, including image segmentation, feature extraction, and optimization of classifiers. Their performances are evaluated through indicators, such as accuracy, precision, and sensitivity.

Many recent studies suggest using multi-domain data pooled from different acquisition sites/centers to improve statistical power. However, medical images from different sites cannot be easily shared to build large datasets for model training due to privacy protection reasons. As a promising solution, federated learning, which enables collaborative training of machine learning models based on data from different sites without cross-site data sharing, has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent development of federated learning methods in medical image analysis. We have systematically gathered research papers on federated learning and its applications in medical image analysis published between 2017 and 2023. Our search and compilation were conducted using databases from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. In this survey, we first introduce the background of federated learning for dealing with privacy protection and collaborative learning issues. We then present a comprehensive review of recent advances in federated learning methods for medical image analysis. Specifically, existing methods are categorized based on three critical aspects of a federated learning system, including client end, server end, and communication techniques. In each category, we summarize the existing federated learning methods according to specific research problems in medical image analysis and also provide insights into the motivations of different approaches. In addition, we provide a review of existing benchmark medical imaging datasets and software platforms for current federated learning research. We also conduct an experimental study to empirically evaluate typical federated learning methods for medical image analysis.

abstract = {Objectives
The transition from manual to automatic cephalometric landmark identification has not yet reached a consensus for clinical application in orthodontic diagnosis. The present umbrella review aimed to assess artificial intelligence (AI) performance in automatic 2D and 3D cephalometric landmark identification.
Data
A combination of free text words and MeSH keywords pooled by boolean operators: Automa* AND cephalo* AND (“artificial intelligence” OR “machine learning” OR “deep learning” OR “learning”).
Sources
A search strategy without a timeframe setting was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and LILACS.
Study selection
The study protocol followed the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO question was formulated according to the aim of the article. The database search led to the selection of 15 articles that were assessed for eligibility in full-text. Finally, 11 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed according to the risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool.
Conclusions
AI was not able to identify the various cephalometric landmarks with the same accuracy. Since most of the included studies' conclusions were based on a wrong 2 mm cut-off difference between the AI automatic landmark location and that allocated by human operators, future research should focus on refining the most powerful architectures to improve the clinical relevance of AI-driven automatic cephalometric analysis.
Clinical significance
Despite a progressively improved performance, AI has exceeded the recommended magnitude of error for most cephalometric landmarks. Moreover, AI automatic landmarking on 3D CBCT appeared to be less accurate compared to that on 2D X-rays. To date, AI-driven cephalometric landmarking still requires the final supervision of an experienced orthodontist.}

abstract = {Clinical Relevance
Glaucoma is a complex eye condition with varied morphological and clinical presentations, making diagnosis and management challenging. The lack of a consensus definition for glaucoma or glaucomatous optic neuropathy further complicates the development of universal diagnostic tools. Developing robust artificial intelligence (AI) models for glaucoma screening is essential for early detection and treatment but faces significant obstacles. Effective deep learning algorithms require large, well-curated datasets from diverse patient populations and imaging protocols. However, creating centralized data repositories is hindered by concerns over data sharing, patient privacy, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property. Federated Learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling data to remain locally hosted while facilitating distributed model training across multiple sites.
Methods
A comprehensive literature review was conducted on the application of Federated Learning in training AI models for glaucoma screening. Publications from 1950 to 2024 were searched using databases such as PubMed and IEEE Xplore with keywords including “glaucoma,” “federated learning,” “artificial intelligence,” “deep learning,” “machine learning,” “distributed learning,” “privacy-preserving,” “data sharing,” “medical imaging,” and “ophthalmology.” Articles were included if they discussed the use of FL in glaucoma-related AI tasks or addressed data sharing and privacy challenges in ophthalmic AI development.
Results
FL enables collaborative model development without centralizing sensitive patient data, addressing privacy and regulatory concerns. Studies show that FL can improve model performance and generalizability by leveraging diverse datasets while maintaining data security. FL models have achieved comparable or superior accuracy to those trained on centralized data, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world clinical settings.
Conclusions
Federated Learning presents a promising strategy to overcome current obstacles in developing AI models for glaucoma screening. By balancing the need for extensive, diverse training data with the imperative to protect patient privacy and comply with regulations, FL facilitates collaborative model training without compromising data security. This approach offers a pathway toward more accurate and generalizable AI solutions for glaucoma detection and management.

This survey examines the AI applications in disease detection, differential diagnosis, and post-COVID complication analysis. Our findings show that 53% of the reviewed studies focus on COVID-19 detection, while only 14% address post-COVID complications. This reveals a gap in long-term patient monitoring. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most frequently used models, appearing in 23% of reviewed studies as standalone architectures and even more often in hybrid models. Meanwhile, transformers and multimodal models remain underutilized. Each appears in only 4% of the studies, limiting the integration of diverse data sources, such as imaging, audio, and lab results. Federated learning, a privacy-preserving AI approach, appears in 9% of studies. However, it is still less common than centralized models. This restricts secure and collaborative AI development. Despite these progress, challenges such as data bias, limited model generalization, and ethical concerns persist. Advanced methods including transformer models and knowledge distillation offer potential solutions for improving computational efficiency. To strengthen AI-driven healthcare, this survey highlights three key needs: (1) broader adoption of multimodal AI, (2) development of computationally efficient and interpretable AI models, and (3) increased use of federated learning to support privacy-preserving AI training. By synthesizing insights from various studies, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of AI innovations in COVID-19 research and outlines key directions for future advancements in ethical and scalable AI-driven healthcare.}

abstract = {Background
This scientometric study investigates global trends and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in physiotherapy, including rehabilitation, movement analysis, and telerehabilitation, between 2006 and 2024. The increasing applications of AI in physiotherapy may have the potential to enhance outcomes, increase operational efficiency, and bring innovative solutions. However, the rapid evolution of AI technologies and applications in physiotherapy necessitates critical examination of patterns of research and geographic differences.
Methods
The articles were published and indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, and data collection was done in July 2024. A thorough search query was employed: TITLE-ABS-KEY ("Artificial Intelligence" OR "AI") AND ("Physiotherapy" OR "Physio" OR "PT"), which yielded 377 records. Excluding 35 duplicate records and 2 non-eligible studies screened, 340 studies were included. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed journal articles, conference articles, and review articles in the English language with a minimum of five citations. Exclusion criteria ruled out non-peer-reviewed articles, editorials, and non-physiotherapy-related studies.
Findings
The analysis identifies a uniform rate of growth in research productivity with a steep rate of growth between 2019 and 2022 with advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning, wearable technology, and robot rehabilitation. The major research institutions were mapped in North America, Europe, and Asia; however, significant geographic disparities exist. Bibliometric indicators, such as H-index, collaboration networks, and co-authorship analysis, were used to quantify the productivity of authors, journals, and institutions.
Interpretation
AI has shown its potential to transform physiotherapy, in particular, to maximize rehabilitation and treatment outcomes. The review does note, however, that future studies should consider ethical factors, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and explainability. The findings suggest the significance of exploring the long-term clinical impact of AI and interdisciplinary collaboration to address regional inequalities. Research needs to be carried out in underexplored areas, such as pediatric rehabilitation and AI-based decision-making systems, to ascertain even and effective AI integration into physiotherapy practice among populations.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate spectrum bias in stroke MRI analysis by excluding cases with uncertain acute ischemic lesions (AIL) and examining patient, imaging, and lesion factors associated with these cases.
Materials and Methods
This single-center retrospective observational study included adults with brain MRIs for suspected stroke between January 2020 and April 2022. Diagnostic uncertain AIL were identified through reader disagreement or low certainty grading by a radiology resident, a neuroradiologist, and the original radiology report consisting of various neuroradiologists. A commercially available deep learning tool analyzing brain MRIs for AIL was evaluated to assess the impact of excluding uncertain cases on diagnostic odds ratios. Patient-related, MRI acquisition-related, and lesion-related factors were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, χ2 test, and multiple logistic regression. The study was approved by the National Committee on Health Research Ethics.
Results
In 989 patients (median age 73 (IQR: 59–80), 53% female), certain AIL were found in 374 (38%), uncertain AIL in 63 (6%), and no AIL in 552 (56%). Excluding uncertain cases led to a four-fold increase in the diagnostic odds ratio (from 68 to 278), while a simulated case-control design resulted in a six-fold increase compared to the full disease spectrum (from 68 to 431). Independent factors associated with uncertain AIL were MRI artifacts, smaller lesion size, older lesion age, and infratentorial location.
Conclusion
Excluding uncertain cases leads to a four-fold overestimation of the diagnostic odds ratio. MRI artifacts, smaller lesion size, infratentorial location, and older lesion age are associated with uncertain AIL and should be accounted for in validation studies.}

Although encoder–decoder models have significantly advanced this domain, their opaque internal processes continue to impede clinical trust and regulatory acceptance. This survey presents a comprehensive methodological review of interpretability techniques applied to MRG, with particular emphasis on mechanistic interpretability. This emerging paradigm shifts the focus from attribution-based methods towards uncovering how specific model components such as neurons, attention heads, and residual connections encode diagnostic logic. We categorise core techniques including activation patching, causal tracing, circuit decomposition, and concept bottleneck probing, and propose a structured taxonomy spanning modalities, architectures, and evaluation strategies. Unlike conventional post hoc attribution methods, mechanistic approaches aim to provide causal, component-level explanations that are predictive and verifiable. We identify major challenges in this area, including cross-modal entanglement, the absence of internal ground-truth benchmarks, and the need for clinically aligned evaluation protocols. To address these limitations, we outline future research directions involving interpretable-by-design architectures, interactive explanation refinement through clinician feedback, and standardised metrics for mechanistic fidelity. By synthesising insights from machine learning, neuroscience, and radiology, this survey establishes a foundation for building MRG systems that are transparent, trustworthy, and clinically useful.}

As AI continues to grow, it will be crucial for healthcare providers and our community as hepatologists to understand the implications and impact of this growth and what this means for our practice and patients. We draw from existing AI frameworks, principles of medical ethics, as well as quality healthcare principles to propose our framework for AI in hepatology. Our proposed framework includes patient-centered care, non-maleficence and safety, equity, transparency, accountability, and security and privacy. For each of these topics, we discuss examples relevant to hepatology. We also propose an action plan for hepatologists on how each of these principles can be upheld in our day-to-day practice. While many hepatology specific AI applications are currently being tested in research studies, they have not yet made it to “prime time.” As a result, the hepatology community has time to consider governance structures to put in place in preparation for the inherent challenges that come with AI implementation and integration into clinical care to ensure that care is responsible, ethical, safe, and secure. With careful and conscientious planning, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for governance, AI can improve quality of health care in hepatology with efficiency, improved safety, and equity.}

This review evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing predictive biomarkers through the integration of radiomics, pathomics, and multi-omics. We conducted a narrative literature review (PubMed; Web of Science; chictr.org.cn; clinicaltrials.gov, 2012–2025) using keywords spanning NSCLC, immunotherapy, and AI methodologies (radiomics, pathomics, and multi-omics). The inclusion criterion was studies that developed predictive models for immune checkpoint inhibitor outcomes; the exclusion criteria were non-original research and preclinical studies. Emerging evidence highlights AI’s transformative role in the prediction of immunotherapy efficacy for treating NSCLC: radiomics quantifies tumor heterogeneity through computed tomography-based PD-L1 and TMB ≥10 mut/Mb biomarkers, while pathomics refines PD-L1 scoring and immune microenvironment classification. Multi-omics integration synergizes imaging, histopathology, and liquid biopsy data with dynamic models by resolving spatial discordance and temporal clonal evolution. However, clinical adoption requires the standardization of peri-tumoral radiomics, validation of delta-feature protocols, and prospective trials to address overfitting risks in small cohorts. AI-driven multi-omics redefines immunotherapy prognostication, but faces interpretability and ethical challenges. Future validation must prioritize prospective multicenter trials, causal biological linking of radiomic features, and federated learning frameworks to ensure equitable clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to transform medical practice within the medical imaging industry and materially improve productivity and patient outcomes. However, low acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention among medical professionals threatens to undermine user uptake levels, hinder meaningful and optimal value-added engagement, and ultimately prevent these promising benefits from being realised. Understanding the factors underpinning AI acceptability will be vital for medical institutions to pinpoint areas of deficiency and improvement within their AI implementation strategies. This scoping review aims to survey the literature to provide a comprehensive summary of the key factors influencing AI acceptability among healthcare professionals in medical imaging domains and the different approaches which have been taken to investigate them.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed across five academic databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Compendex, and Scopus from January 2013 to September 2023. This was done in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Overall, 31 articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in the scoping review.
Results
The literature has converged towards three overarching categories of factors underpinning AI acceptability including: user factors involving trust, system understanding, AI literacy, and technology receptiveness; system usage factors entailing value proposition, self-efficacy, burden, and workflow integration; and socio-organisational-cultural factors encompassing social influence, organisational readiness, ethicality, and perceived threat to professional identity. Yet, numerous studies have overlooked a meaningful subset of these factors that are integral to the use of medical AI systems such as the impact on clinical workflow practices, trust based on perceived risk and safety, and compatibility with the norms of medical professions. This is attributable to reliance on theoretical frameworks or ad-hoc approaches which do not explicitly account for healthcare-specific factors, the novelties of AI as software as a medical device (SaMD), and the nuances of human-AI interaction from the perspective of medical professionals rather than lay consumer or business end users.
Conclusion
This is the first scoping review to survey the health informatics literature around the key factors influencing the acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention in medical imaging contexts. The factors identified in this review suggest that existing theoretical frameworks used to study AI acceptability need to be modified to better capture the nuances of AI deployment in healthcare contexts where the user is a healthcare professional influenced by expert knowledge and disciplinary norms. Increasing AI acceptability among medical professionals will critically require designing human-centred AI systems which go beyond high algorithmic performance to consider accessibility to users with varying degrees of AI literacy, clinical workflow practices, the institutional and deployment context, and the cultural, ethical, and safety norms of healthcare professions. As investment into AI for healthcare increases, it would be valuable to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the causal contribution of these factors to achieving high levels of AI acceptability among medical professionals.}

Owing to the ability to accurately identify and categorize both diseased and normal soft- and hard-tissue structures, DL has high application potential in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors and in orthognathic surgeries. Moreover, DL and ML can be used to develop prediction models that can aid surgeons to assess prognosis by analyzing the patient's medical history, imaging data, and surgical records, develop more effective treatment strategies, select appropriate surgical modalities, and evaluate the risk of postoperative complications. Such prediction models can play a crucial role in the selection of treatment strategies for oral and maxillofacial surgeries. Their practical application can improve the utilization of medical staff, increase the treatment accuracy and efficiency, reduce surgical risks, and provide an enhanced treatment experience to patients. However, DL and ML face limitations, such as data drift, unstable model results, and vulnerable social trust. With the advancement of social concepts and technologies, the use of these models in oral and maxillofacial surgery is anticipated to become more comprehensive and extensive.}

This narrative review explores the evolving landscape of AI in HPB oncology, with a focus on ethical integration, healthcare equity, and clinical applicability. Key issues discussed include algorithmic bias, informed consent, model explainability, and disparities in access to data and AI-driven tools. Promising innovations such as federated learning and large language models are explored for their potential to decentralise model training and enhance multidisciplinary workflows. The review also highlights the integration of AI into surgical navigation systems and intraoperative decision-making, as well as its application to omics data analysis for biomarker discovery. Crucially, it underscores the need for transparent and interpretable systems, the need for prospective validation in diverse populations, and the risk of clinician de-skilling. As AI technologies evolve, their safe and equitable integration into HPB oncology will require robust governance, regulatory foresight, and sustained investment in clinician education and infrastructure.

AI-powered image generation technology holds the potential to reshape medical practice, yet it remains an unfamiliar technology for both medical researchers and clinicians alike. Given the adoption of this technology relies on clinician understanding and acceptance, we sought to demystify its use in ophthalmology. To this end, we present a literature review on image generation technology in ophthalmology, examining both its theoretical applications and future role in clinical practice.
Methods
First, we consider the key model designs used for image synthesis, including generative adversarial networks, autoencoders, and diffusion models. We then perform a survey of the literature for image generation technology in ophthalmology prior to September 2024, presenting both the type of model used and its clinical application. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this technology, the risks of its misuse and the future directions of research in this field.
Results
Applications of this technology include improving AI diagnostic models, inter-modality image transformation, more accurate treatment and disease prognostication, image denoising, and individualised education. Key barriers to its adoption include bias in generative models, risks to patient data security, computational and logistical barriers to development, challenges with model explainability, inconsistent use of validation metrics between studies and misuse of synthetic images. Looking forward, researchers are placing a further emphasis on clinically grounded metrics, the development of image generation foundation models and the implementation of methods to ensure data provenance.
Conclusion
Compared to other medical applications of AI, image generation is still in its infancy. Yet, it holds the potential to revolutionise ophthalmology across research, education and clinical practice. This review aims to guide ophthalmic researchers wanting to leverage this technology, while also providing an insight for clinicians on how it may change ophthalmic practice in the future.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform the care of women with cancer. From early detection via digital phenotyping to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, innovative AI applications are rapidly emerging across the cancer care continuum. AI-assisted mammographic screening for breast cancer has been clinically translated, and AI-based contouring in radiotherapy is streamlining treatment planning and improving consistency of cancer care. Research areas include radiomic analysis for ovarian tumour characterisation, machine learning for endometrial cancer subtyping, and automated assessment for cervical cancer screening. Challenges such as data scarcity and tumour heterogeneity in gynaecological cancers hinder the development of robust AI models, a problem further compounded by the limited availability of large, prospective validation cohorts. Emerging generative AI and multimodal AI systems hold promise to address these limitations by leveraging large-scale, diverse training datasets. Building trust in AI systems will require rigorous prospective real-life validation, regulatory oversights, and well-defined legal frameworks. A key opportunity exists to develop inclusive, clinically meaningful AI devices across all women’s cancers, driven by rapid advances in AI in health care and strengthened by national and international initiatives promoting health-care innovation. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, AI has the potential to move beyond research and help in early diagnoses and provide personalised treatment strategies. In this Series paper, we review AI developments in breast and gynaecological cancers, including applications in clinical adoption and those actively being developed to address unmet needs in early detection, characterisation, treatment, and prognostication.}

The purpose of this scoping paper was to identify critical decontamination and sterilization needs for the medtech and pharmaceutical sectors with a focus on understanding how to effectively use the Penta helix hub framework that combines academia, industry, healthcare, policy-makers/regulators and patients/society. A PRISMA scoping review of PubMed publications was conducted over the period 2010 to January 2025. Thirty of the 124 ‘helix hub’ papers addressed innovation where only 3 of 16 healthcare-focused helices used or mentioned the need for key performance indicators (KPIs). Early-phase helix innovation ecosystems are mainly supported by qualitative or non-empirical data. This review explores multi-actor needs along with describing quantifiable KPIs at micro (end-user), meso (innovation hub) and macro (regional, national and international) levels. This integrated Penta hub approach will help to effectively plan, co-create, manage, analyse and utilize voluminous data, for example there are ca. 60,000 and 56,000 publications per year on artificial intelligence (AI) and medical devices respectively along, with some 35,000 adverse reports on devices submitted to the US FDA. This review addresses sustaining and potentially disruptive opportunities for decontamination and sterilization that includes the use of AI-enabled devices, bespoke training and sustainability.}

Significant heterogeneity in PE presentations and limitations in contemporary risk stratification approaches are hypothesized to be important drivers of poorer than expected outcomes. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained attention in cardiovascular medicine, notably in wearable technology, electrocardiography, and cardiovascular imaging. The utility of AI has been studied in PE diagnosis and risk stratification, especially in hospitalized patients and has the potential to predict presence of PE based on electrocardiography and clinical risk factors, decrease time to diagnosis, and improve characterization of PE as acute versus chronic. However, AI systems do not appear to have better accuracy in identification of PE compared with radiologists. Additionally, whether utilization of AI in diagnosis and management of PE will improve clinician workflow and patient outcomes remains unknown. In this review, we critically appraise the literature on AI-based strategies to diagnose and refine risk stratification of acute PE and discuss how integration of AI may move the field of PE forward with the universal goal of improving short- and long-term PE-related outcomes.}

At Stanford University, we have developed a successful model for an AI/ML research center with support from academic leaders, clinical departments, extramural grants, and industry partners. The Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging uses the following 4 key tactics to support AI/ML research: project-based learning opportunities that build interdisciplinary collaboration; internal grant programs that catalyze extramural funding; infrastructure that facilitates the rapid creation of large multimodal AI-ready clinical data sets; and educational and open data programs that engage the broader research community. The center is based on the premise that foundational and applied research are not in tension but instead are complementary. Solving important biomedical problems with AI/ML requires high-quality foundational team science that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of clinicians, clinician scientists, computer scientists, and data scientists.

abstract = {Purpose
We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting coronary artery stenosis and calcified plaque on CT angiography (CTA), comparing its diagnostic performance with that of radiologists.
Methods
A thorough search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase, focusing on studies published until October 2024. Studies were included if they evaluated AI models in detecting coronary artery stenosis and calcified plaque on CTA. A bivariate random-effects model was employed to determine combined sensitivity and specificity. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool, and the evidence level was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalutiuon (GRADE) system.
Results
Out of 1071 initially identified studies, 17 studies with 5560 patients and images were ultimately included for the final analysis. For coronary artery stenosis ≥50%, AI showed a sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88–0.95), specificity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80–0.92), and AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.97), outperforming radiologists with sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67–0.94), specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62–0.94), and AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.93). For stenosis ≥70%, AI achieved a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70–0.96), specificity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90–0.99), and AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96–0.99). In calcified plaque detection, AI demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.84–0.97), specificity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88–0.96), and AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96–0.99)."
Conclusion
AI-based CT demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to clinicians in identifying ≥50% stenosis in coronary arteries and showed excellent diagnostic performance in recognizing ≥70% coronary artery stenosis and calcified plaque. However, limitations include retrospective study designs and heterogeneity in CTA technologies. Further external validation through prospective, multicenter trials is required to confirm these findings.

Liquid biopsy has emerged as an appealing method that makes it unnecessary to use invasive procedures. It depicts the biology of tumors at first sight based on circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and exosomes in the blood of the patient. This paper provides a review of the likelihood of the integration of liquid biopsy with medical imaging methods, such as MRI, CT, PET, and ultrasound, to enhance the accuracy of tumor identification. We expand on how liquid biopsy might improve healthcare imaging by defining tumor characterization more accurately and precisely, avoiding false positive and negative values, and providing genetic integration information that is often useful when interpreting imaging scans. Case examples are employed to demonstrate the seamless combination of liquid biopsy data with imaging outcomes, which can help expand the understanding of cancer pathophysiology and treatment sensitivity. However, artificial intelligence and machine learning should be used to support the execution of this supposed synergistically integrated strategy. The article also explains the problems concerning the integration of these two diagnostic methods and stresses the importance of standardizing the procedures and cooperation between the disciplines. This aggregation could result in earlier detection, improved monitoring, as well as individual approaches to cancer patients, hence leading to a significant increase in positive clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT-based artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through December 2024, following PRISMA-DTA guidelines. Studies evaluating CT-based AI models for diagnosing cervical LNM in patients with pathologically confirmed PTC were included. The methodological quality was assessed using a modified QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics, and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.
Results
17 studies comprising 1778 patients in internal validation sets and 4072 patients in external validation sets were included. In internal validation sets, AI demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71–0.86), specificity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73–0.84), and AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83–0.89). Radiologists suggested comparable performance with sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64–0.87), specificity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.85), and AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81–0.88). Subgroup analyses revealed that deep learning methods outperformed machine learning in sensitivity (0.86 vs 0.72, P<0.05). No significant publication bias was found in internal validation sets for AI diagnosis (P=0.78).
Conclusion
CT-based AI showed comparable diagnostic performance to radiologists for detecting cervical LNM in PTC patients, with deep learning models showing superior sensitivity. AI could potentially serve as a valuable diagnostic support tool, though further prospective validation is warranted. Limitations include high heterogeneity among studies and insufficient external validation in diverse populations.}

abstract = {Objectives
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the current performance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for tooth segmentation in three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, with a focus on their accuracy and efficiency compared to those of manual segmentation techniques.
Data
The data analyzed in this review consisted of a wide range of research studies utilizing AI algorithms for tooth segmentation in CBCT images. Meta-analysis was performed, focusing on the evaluation of the segmentation results using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC).
Sources
PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Explore were comprehensively searched to identify relevant studies. The initial search yielded 5642 entries, and subsequent screening and selection processes led to the inclusion of 35 studies in the systematic review. Among the various segmentation methods employed, convolutional neural networks, particularly the U-net model, are the most commonly utilized. The pooled effect of the DSC score for tooth segmentation was 0.95 (95 %CI 0.94 to 0.96). Furthermore, seven papers provided insights into the time required for segmentation, which ranged from 1.5 s to 3.4 min when utilizing AI techniques.
Conclusions
AI models demonstrated favorable accuracy in automatically segmenting teeth from CBCT images while reducing the time required for the process. Nevertheless, correction methods for metal artifacts and tooth structure segmentation using different imaging modalities should be addressed in future studies.
Clinical significance
AI algorithms have great potential for precise tooth measurements, orthodontic treatment planning, dental implant placement, and other dental procedures that require accurate tooth delineation. These advances have contributed to improved clinical outcomes and patient care in dental practice.}

This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term “eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence” (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore “global” modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks.

Meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the models, and a co-authorship and keyword analysis was performed to examine collaborative networks within the field.
Results
The included studies primarily focused on model development (77 %), with only 23 % incorporating external validation, raising concerns about generalizability across clinical contexts. Meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 78.1 % and 70.6 % for development-only studies, while studies with external validation achieved higher sensitivity (81.5 %) and specificity (79.5 %). Co-authorship analysis identified 67 contributors across eight collaboration clusters, indicating a specialized but emerging research field.
Discussion
The findings highlight the need for multifactorial models that integrate diverse predictors to improve the performance and reliability of ML-based ADR prediction. Addressing these limitations through rigorous model development and validation processes could enhance the clinical applicability of AI-driven pharmacovigilance, ultimately advancing patient safety and healthcare outcomes.}

Breast cancer (BRCA) is a multifaceted and extremely diverse condition, with conventional diagnostic and therapeutic methods encountering considerable obstacles. With the increasing amount of medical data and the ongoing development of computer technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has become widely used in BRCA medication research and clinical decision-making. Specifically, AI helps anticipate therapy responses, makes it easier to choose the best treatment regimens based on the molecular and pathological features of tumors, and allows for more accurate risk assessments for BRCA. AI is also essential to drug development, including the identification and prediction of novel therapeutic targets, the screening and prediction of compound structures, the repurposing of existing drugs, and the creation of combination treatments. From static assessments based on molecular subtypes to dynamic tracking of disease development, AI's role in BRCA diagnosis and therapy has changed throughout time. It has transitioned from experience-based therapeutic approaches to data-driven clinical decision-making. In addition to improving patients' quality of life, this shift is essential to turning cancer therapy into a "prevention-prediction-personalized" paradigm. This review article thoroughly examines the developments in AI applications for important fields such as molecular subtype identification, metastasis and recurrence prediction, BRCA risk stratification, and the creation of new medications. It delves deeper into current technological constraints and clinical translation pathways, emphasizing the need for advances in clinical applicability and technical standardization through tactics like large-scale multi-center clinical trials, innovative cross-modal data integration, and algorithmic architecture optimization.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.}

abstract = {Purpose
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of MRI-based deep learning (DL) algorithms versus radiologists in detecting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to June 30, 2025 for studies evaluating MRI-based DL algorithms for LNM diagnosis, using histopathology as the reference standard. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the PROBAST+AI tool. Certainty of evidence was rated with the GRADE approach.
Results
A total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria. Internal validation cohorts (9 studies, n=1850) showed pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80–0.94), specificity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77–0.91), and AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91–0.95). Radiologists achieved lower pooled sensitivity of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60–0.71) and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71–0.77), with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73–0.80). DL algorithms in internal validation cohorts consistently outperformed junior radiologists in all metrics, and demonstrated higher sensitivity and AUC than senior radiologists(all P<0.05).
Conclusion
MRI-based DL algorithms show promising diagnostic performance in detecting LNM in CRC, with performance generally higher than those reported for radiologists in internal validation cohorts, particularly junior-experienced readers. However, most included studies were retrospective and originated from China, limiting generalizability. Prospective, multicenter studies are warranted to validate these findings across diverse populations.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) in medical imaging for improving clinical procedures related to the mandibular third molar (MM3).
Methods
Our systematic search included databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, up to April 10, 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the potential bias and clinical relevance of the studies. To examine the interaction between MM3 and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), we conducted a meta-analysis using a bivariate mixed-effects model to compare the performance of DL methods with that of human experts.
Results
In this comprehensive review, a total of 33 scholarly works involving 45,029 imaging instances were analyzed. Among these, 15 studies specifically focused on evaluating the performance of DL methods in identifying the spatial relationship between MM3 and IAN. The aggregated results showed that DL achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.93). In parallel, a comparative meta-analysis that included assessments from 16 clinical experts revealed slightly lower sensitivity (0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.85) and specificity (0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94). Additionally, the review explored the utility of DL in predictive modeling of MM3 eruption, assessing the complexity of extraction procedures, and identifying MM3 characteristics. The 18 studies in this area demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 0.80 to 0.94 and specificity from 0.75 to 0.97, collectively highlighting the strong prognostic capabilities of DL in these clinical applications.
Conclusions
DL has demonstrated remarkable efficacy, especially in precisely identifying the anatomical connections between MM3 and IAN. Moreover, DL excels in identifying, categorizing, and assessing the complexity associated with MM3 extractions. This study confirms the substantial value of DL, particularly when utilized through image-based methods, in improving clinical management strategies for MM3. The creation of intelligent diagnostic tools using oral panoramic radiographs (OPGs) is strongly encouraged to assist physicians, especially those with limited clinical experience, in enhancing their diagnostic accuracy. These advancements in DL applications are expected to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical diagnoses in oral and maxillofacial surgeries.}

AI in healthcare uses machine learning (ML) and other predictive analytical techniques to help sort through vast amounts of data and generate outputs that aid in diagnosis, clinical decision support, workflow automation, and prognostication. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an ideal union for these applications due to vast amounts of data generation and analysis during cardiac segmentation, coronary calcium scoring, plaque quantification, adipose tissue quantification, peri-operative planning, fractional flow reserve quantification, and cardiac event prediction. In the past 5 years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies exploring the use of AI for cardiac computed tomography (CT) image acquisition, de-noising, analysis, and prognosis. Beyond image processing, AI has also been applied to improve the imaging workflow in areas such as patient scheduling, urgent result notification, report generation, and report communication. In this review, we discuss algorithms applicable to AI and radiomic analysis; we then present a summary of current and emerging clinical applications of AI in cardiac CT.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge and continues to affect millions worldwide despite decades of control efforts. The disease can remain dormant and symptom-free for long periods, especially in high-risk populations such as household contacts, immunocompromised individuals and people living in crowded environments. Delayed detection of these silent cases fuels ongoing transmission. Chest X-ray imaging is widely used for screening, yet radiographic signs in early TB are subtle and easily confused with other lung conditions. Shortage of trained radiologists, subjective interpretation and limited data further complicate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled automated detection, but conventional convolutional neural networks often require large labelled datasets and struggle to capture global context in images. This paper proposes a machine-learning framework that combines contrastive pretraining with a fine-tuned vision transformer (CPT-TB) for early detection of TB in asymptomatic, high-risk populations. We utilize the publicly available chest X-ray dataset which contains 4200 images, including 3500 normal X-rays and 700 images from TB patients. Contrastive pretraining leverages unlabeled images by creating multiple augmented views and learning representations that bring similar views closer while pushing dissimilar examples apart. A transformer architecture with self-attention is then fine-tuned on the labelled portion of the dataset. The attention mechanism aggregates information across the entire lung field, capturing subtle pathological patterns that are difficult for CNNs to learn. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over standard models. In five-fold cross-validation, CPT-TB achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 98.2 %, accuracy of 95.5 %, sensitivity of 94.9 % and specificity of 96.0 %. These results represent a 4.0 % increase in accuracy compared to a supervised ResNet-50 baseline and a 2.3 % improvement over a supervised vision transformer. Beyond these quantitative gains, attention maps offer interpretable visual cues for clinicians. The proposed CPT-TB framework shows promise for scalable, non-invasive screening and could facilitate active case finding in resource-constrained settings where radiological expertise is scarce.}

abstract = {Background
Machine learning techniques hold significant potential to support the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. However, the success of these approaches is heavily dependent on rigorous data acquisition, preprocessing and data organization.
Methods
This article reviews the literature to evaluate key factors in dataset construction, focusing on data structure, preprocessing, and data organization, particularly in the context of imaging data.
Results
The main issues with data construction when dealing with medical applications are noise (incorrect or irrelevant data), sparsity/ limited availability, representativeness/variability, and data imbalance (uneven class distribution).While preprocessing steps prepare the data to be suitable for the models, data organization focuses in improving data arranging to increase the model performance. Additionally, the impact of CNN complexity in processing balanced, imbalanced, and complex datasets shows that complex CNNs are not always the optimal choice for every classification problem.
Conclusion
By integrating knowledge from Health Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, we aim to enhance healthcare professionals' understanding of machine learning for image analysis in Oral Medicine and Pathology. This encourages their involvement in patient recruitment and data acquisition, broadening their roles and significantly contributing to the creation of well-characterized datasets for future research and applications.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease with a rapidly growing incidence worldwide. For prognostication and therapeutic decisions, it is important to distinguish the pathological stages of NAFLD: steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis, which are definitively diagnosed on invasive biopsy. Non-invasive ultrasound (US) imaging, including US elastography technique, and clinical parameters can be used to diagnose and grade NAFLD and its complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being harnessed for developing NAFLD diagnostic models based on clinical, biomarker, or imaging data. In this work, we systemically reviewed the literature for AI-enabled NAFLD diagnostic models based on US (including elastography) and clinical (including serological) data.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive search on Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed search engines for articles published between January 2005 and June 2023 related to AI models for NAFLD diagnosis based on US and/or clinical parameters using the following search terms: “non-alcoholic fatty liver disease”, “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis”, “deep learning”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, “ultrasound imaging”, “sonography”, “clinical information”.
Results
We reviewed 64 published models that used either US (including elastography) or clinical data input to detect the presence of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and/or fibrosis, and in some cases, the severity of steatosis, inflammation, and/or fibrosis as well. The performances of the published models were summarized, and stratified by data input and algorithms used, which could be broadly divided into machine and deep learning approaches.
Conclusion
AI models based on US imaging and clinical data can reliably detect NAFLD and its complications, thereby reducing diagnostic costs and the need for invasive liver biopsy. The models offer advantages of efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility, and serve as virtual assistants for specialists to accelerate disease diagnosis and reduce treatment costs for patients and healthcare systems.}

abstract = {[18F]FDG PET/CT is a powerful imaging modality of high performance in multiple myeloma (MM) and is considered the appropriate method for assessing treatment response in this disease. On the other hand, due to the heterogeneous and sometimes complex patterns of bone marrow infiltration in MM, the interpretation of PET/CT can be particularly challenging, hampering interobserver reproducibility and limiting the diagnostic and prognostic ability of the modality. Although many approaches have been developed to address the issue of standardization, none can yet be considered a standard method for interpretation or objective quantification of PET/CT. Therefore, advanced diagnostic quantification approaches are needed to support and potentially guide the management of MM. In recent years, radiomics has emerged as an innovative method for high-throughput mining of image-derived features for clinical decision making, which may be particularly helpful in oncology. In addition, machine learning and deep learning, both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) closely related to the radiomics process, have been increasingly applied to automated image analysis, offering new possibilities for a standardized evaluation of imaging modalities such as CT, PET/CT and MRI in oncology. In line with this, the initial but steadily growing literature on the application of radiomics and AI-based methods in the field of [18F]FDG PET/CT in MM has already yielded encouraging results, offering a potentially reliable tool towards optimization and standardization of interpretation in this disease. The main results of these studies are presented in this review.}

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography (PSMA PET) with conventional imaging modalities in detecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, and to assess the role of artificial intelligence in this context.
Materials and Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus was conducted for studies, initially on May 7, 2025, and updated on July 28, 2025. Studies that compared PSMA PET with conventional imaging and assessed artificial intelligence for detecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer were considered. The QUADAS-2 technique was employed to evaluate study quality. Diagnosis accuracy and detection rates were aggregated utilizing a bivariate random-effects model.
Results
A total of 7637 patients from 67 studies were included. PSMA PET demonstrated significantly higher overall diagnostic accuracy for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer compared to mpMRI, CT, and AI test sets, with accuracy values of (0.89 vs. 0.71, 0.45, and 0.76, P<0.01). For local recurrence, mpMRI outperformed PSMA PET and CT (0.93 vs. 0.84 and 0.77, P<0.01). PSMA PET was superior in detecting lymph node metastasis than mpMRI and CT (0.89 vs. 0.79 and 0.72, P<0.05). For bone metastasis, PSMA PET outperformed mpMRI, CT, and Bone scan (0.95 vs. 0.85, 0.81, and 0.80, P<0.05). For visceral metastasis, PSMA PET outperformed mpMRI (0.96 vs. 0.89, P=0.23), and CT (0.96 vs. 0.78, P<0.05). 21 studies involving 3113 samples were included to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence in detecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of AI test sets in detecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer were 0.77, 0.76, 10.39, and 0.79. Heterogeneity limits the generalizability of our findings.
Conclusion
PSMA PET outperformed mpMRI and CT in detecting overall, local recurrence, bone, and visceral metastasis, while mpMRI was more effective for local recurrence. While AI exhibits potential diagnostic efficacy. Despite promising results, heterogeneity and limited validation highlight the need for further research to support routine clinical use.}

Pain is a challenging multifaceted symptom reported by most cancer patients. This systematic review aims to explore applications of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in predicting pain-related outcomes and pain management in cancer.
Methods
A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was conducted using terms: “Cancer,” “Pain,” “Pain Management,” “Analgesics,” “Artificial Intelligence,” “Machine Learning,” and “Neural Networks” published up to September 7, 2023. AI/ML models, their validation and performance were summarized. Quality assessment was conducted using PROBAST risk-of-bias andadherence to TRIPOD guidelines.
Results
Forty four studies from 2006 to 2023 were included. Nineteen studies used AI/ML for classifying pain after cancer therapy [median AUC 0.80 (range 0.76–0.94)]. Eighteen studies focused on cancer pain research [median AUC 0.86 (range 0.50–0.99)], and 7 focused on applying AI/ML for cancer pain management, [median AUC 0.71 (range 0.47–0.89)]. Median AUC (0.77) of models across all studies. Random forest models demonstrated the highest performance (median AUC 0.81), lasso models had the highest median sensitivity (1), while Support Vector Machine had the highest median specificity (0.74). Overall adherence to TRIPOD guidelines was 70.7%. Overall, high risk-of-bias (77.3%), lack of external validation (14%) and clinical application (23%) was detected. Reporting of model calibration was also missing (5%).
Conclusion
Implementation of AI/ML tools promises significant advances in the classification, risk stratification, and management decisions for cancer pain. Further research focusing on quality improvement, model calibration, rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology may necessitate refinement of the competencies expected of radiologists. There is currently a lack of understanding on what competencies radiology residency programs should ensure their graduates attain related to AI. This study aimed to identify what knowledge, skills, and attitudes are important for radiologists to use AI safely and effectively in clinical practice.
Methods
Following Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology, a scoping review was conducted by searching electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and ERIC) for articles published between 2010 and 2024. Two reviewers independently screened articles based on the title and abstract and subsequently by full-text review. Data were extracted using a standardized form to identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes surrounding AI that may be important for its safe and effective use.
Results
Of 5920 articles screened, 49 articles met inclusion criteria. Core competencies were related to AI model development, evaluation, clinical implementation, algorithm bias and handling discrepancies, regulation, ethics, medicolegal issues, and economics of AI. While some papers proposed competencies for radiologists focused on technical development of AI algorithms, other papers centered competencies around clinical implementation and use of AI.
Conclusion
Current AI educational programming in radiology demonstrates substantial heterogeneity with a lack of consensus on the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for the safe and effective use of AI in radiology. Further research is needed to develop consensus on the core competencies for radiologists to safely and effectively use AI to support the integration of AI training and assessment into residency programs.}

abstract = {The risk of discovering an intracranial aneurysm during the initial screening and follow-up screening are reported as around 11%, and 7% respectively (Zuurbie et al., 2023) to these mass effects, unruptured aneurysms frequently generate symptoms, however, the real hazard occurs when an aneurysm ruptures and results in a cerebral hemorrhage known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The objective is to study the multiple kinds of hemorrhage and aneurysm detection problems and develop machine and deep learning models to recognise them. Due to its early stage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most typical symptom after aneurysm rupture, is an important medical condition. It frequently results in severe neurological emergencies or even death. Although most aneurysms are asymptomatic and won't burst, because of their unpredictable growth, even small aneurysms are susceptible. A timely diagnosis is essential to prevent early mortality because a large percentage of hemorrhage cases present can be fatal. Physiological/imaging markers and the degree of the subarachnoid hemorrhage can be used as indicators for potential early treatments in hemorrhage. The hemodynamic pathomechanisms and microcellular environment should remain a priority for academics and medical professionals. There is still disagreement about how and when to care for aneurysms that have not ruptured despite studies reporting on the risk of rupture and outcomes. We are optimistic that with the progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of hemorrhages and aneurysms and the advancement of artificial intelligence has made it feasible to conduct analyses with a high degree of precision, effectiveness and reliability.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods enable humans to analyse large amounts of data, which would otherwise not be feasibly quantifiable. This is especially true for unstructured visual and textual data, which can contain invaluable insights into disease. The hepatology research landscape is complex and has generated large amounts of data to be mined. Many open questions can potentially be addressed with existing data through AI methods. However, the field of AI is sometimes obscured by hype cycles and imprecise terminologies. This can conceal the fact that numerous hepatology research groups already use AI methods in their scientific studies. In this review article, we aim to assess the contemporaneous use of AI methods in hepatology in Europe. To achieve this, we systematically surveyed all scientific contributions presented at the EASL Congress 2024. Out of 1,857 accepted abstracts (1,712 posters and 145 oral presentations), 6 presentations (∼4%) and 69 posters (∼4%) utilised AI methods. Of these, 55 posters were included in this review, while the others were excluded due to missing posters or incomplete methodologies. Finally, we summarise current academic trends in the use of AI methods and outline future directions, providing guidance for scientific stakeholders in the field of hepatology.}

There have been several proposals by researchers for the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology due to its promising role in radiotherapy practice. However, prior to the introduction of the technology, there are certain general recommendations that must be achieved. Also, the current challenges of AI must be addressed. In this review, we assess how Africa is prepared for the integration of AI technology into radiotherapy service delivery.
Methods
To assess the readiness of Africa for integration of AI in radiotherapy services delivery, a narrative review of the available literature from PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scopus was conducted in the English language using search terms such as Artificial Intelligence, Radiotherapy in Africa, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Quality Assurance.
Results
We identified a number of issues that could limit the successful integration of AI technology into radiotherapy practice. The major issues include insufficient data for training and validation of AI models, lack of educational curriculum for AI radiotherapy-related courses, no/limited AI teaching professionals, funding, and lack of AI technology and resources. Solutions identified to facilitate smooth implementation of the technology into radiotherapy practices within the region include: creating an accessible national data bank, integrating AI radiotherapy training programs into Africa’s educational curriculum, investing in AI technology and resources such as electronic health records and cloud storage, and creation of legal laws and policies to support the use of the technology. These identified solutions need to be implemented on the background of creating awareness among health workers within the radiotherapy space.
Conclusion
The challenges identified in this review are common among all the geographical regions in the African continent. Therefore, all institutions offering radiotherapy education and training programs, management of the medical centers for radiotherapy and oncology, national and regional professional bodies for medical physics, ministries of health, governments, and relevant stakeholders must take keen interest and work together to achieve this goal.}

In order to provide precision medicine, models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) combine imaging, histopathological, and genomic data. Few studies reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved higher accuracy in feature extraction and tumor classification, whereas Random Forest (RF) models demonstrated considerable specificity in detecting the disease associated with genetic mutations. AI also enables targeted immunotherapy by identifying molecular markers and optimising drug responses to individual patients. SVM and RF classify AdCC subtypes based on MYB::NFIB fusion, NOTCH, and WNT pathways. DL models analyse imaging and histology to assess immune infiltration and predict response to checkpoint inhibitors. GBM models group patients by PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathway alterations for tailored immunotherapies. AI further enhances CAR-T cell therapy by predicting the presentation of neoantigens and engineering T-cell receptors. Real-time treatment monitoring is made possible by liquid biopsies that use AI-driven ctDNA and immune profiling.

abstract = {Introduction/Background
Modern forms of Artificial intelligence (AI) have developed in radiology over the past few years. With the current workforce shortages, in both radiology and radiography professions, AI continues to prove its place in supporting clinical radiology processes. The aim of the scoping review was to investigate the existing literature on the topic of preference of use of artificial intelligence interfaces within a radiology context.
Methods
Using a systematic approach, papers were chosen against an inclusion criterion of addressing radiological AI user interface preferences to be included in the scoping review. Arksey O'Malley's and Levac's framework were used to inform the procedural steps for the scoping review. Four databases were searched including MEDLINE Ovid, Scopus, Web of Science and Engineering Village. Reliability was improved through the involvement of three researchers to select the papers against the inclusion criteria.
Results
Six papers were identified to fit the inclusion criteria of radiological AI user interface preferences. These varied methodologically including two observational studies, two simulated user testing studies, a diagnostic accuracy study and a multi-case study. AI user interfaces were evaluated in two studies. Mixed responses were obtained with some alignment in preference for heatmap image overlays and highly detailed user interfaces are linked to higher preference amongst users. Limited literature exists on AI user interfaces and a lack of research evaluating current AI interface preference, either in post or pre-deployment.
Discussion
The mix of methods used within studies indicated that there is not yet a standardised method for assessing AI tool design and preference within radiology, with common use of a System Usability Scale survey tool in conjunction with another method. There was also a varied response when considering the preferred user interface in radiology, though simple, non-complicated designs were suggested to be ideal by participants.
Conclusion
Medical imaging AI user interface research is essential for the acceptability of AI technology into radiology departments. This scoping review identified the current landscape of AI user interface research within a radiology setting. There is a requirement for more radiology AI research focussing on end user or imaging professional involvement and their preferences. There is an explicit need for further research in the field, due to the lack of standardised outcome measures, lack clear findings regarding ideal user interfaces and lack of inclusion of radiographers. The dearth of studies including radiographers and small sample sizes of participants within these studies identifies the mindset shift required for radiology, and AI vendors alike.
Résumé
Introduction/Contexte
Des formes modernes d'intelligence artificielle (IA) se sont développées en radiologie au cours des dernières années. Compte tenu de la pénurie actuelle de main-d'œuvre, tant en radiologie qu'en radiographie, l'intelligence artificielle continue de prouver qu'elle a sa place dans les processus de radiologie clinique. L'objectif de cette étude était d'examiner la littérature existante sur le thème de la préférence d'utilisation des interfaces d'intelligence artificielle dans le contexte de la radiologie.
Méthodologie
En utilisant une approche systématique, les auteurs ont sélectionné les articles en fonction d'un critère d'inclusion portant sur les préférences d'utilisation des interfaces d'intelligence artificielle en radiologie, afin de les inclure dans l'étude exploratoire. Le cadre d'Arksey O'Malley et de Levac a été utilisé pour informer les étapes de la procédure de l'examen exploratoire. Quatre bases de données ont été consultées : MEDLINE Ovid, Scopus, Web of Science et Engineering Village. La fiabilité a été améliorée par la participation de trois chercheurs à la sélection des articles en fonction des critères d'inclusion.
Résultats
Six articles répondant aux critères d'inclusion des préférences en matière d'interface utilisateur de l'IA radiologique ont été identifiés. Les méthodes varient : deux études d'observation, deux études de simulation d'essais par l'utilisateur, une étude sur la précision du diagnostic et une étude multi-cas. Les interfaces utilisateur de l'IA ont été évaluées dans deux études. Des réponses mitigées ont été obtenues, avec un certain alignement dans la préférence pour les superpositions d'images de cartes thermiques, et les interfaces utilisateur très détaillées sont liées à une préférence plus élevée parmi les utilisateurs. La littérature sur les interfaces utilisateur de l'IA est limitée et il n'existe pas de recherche évaluant les préférences actuelles en matière d'interface de l'IA, que ce soit en post-déploiement ou en pré-déploiement.
Discussion
Le nombre de méthodes utilisées dans les études indique qu'il n'existe pas encore de méthode standardisée pour évaluer la conception et la préférence des outils d'IA en radiologie, avec l'utilisation courante d'un outil d'enquête System Usability Scale en conjonction avec une autre méthode. Les réponses ont également été variées en ce qui concerne l'interface utilisateur préférée en radiologie, bien que les participants aient suggéré que des conceptions simples et non compliquées soient idéales.
Conclusion
La recherche sur l'interface utilisateur de l'IA en imagerie médicale est essentielle pour l'acceptabilité de la technologie de l'IA dans les services de radiologie. Cet examen exploratoire a permis d'identifier le paysage actuel de la recherche sur l'interface utilisateur de l'IA dans un cadre radiologique. Il est nécessaire de mener davantage de recherches sur l'IA en radiologie, axées sur l'implication de l'utilisateur final ou du professionnel de l'imagerie et sur ses préférences. Il existe un besoin explicite de recherche supplémentaire dans ce domaine, en raison du manque de mesures de résultats standardisées, du manque de conclusions claires concernant les interfaces utilisateur idéales et de l'absence d'inclusion des radiographes. La rareté des études incluant des radiographes et la petite taille des échantillons de participants dans ces études mettent en évidence le changement d'état d'esprit nécessaire pour la radiologie et les fournisseurs d'IA.}

AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), enable the efficient analysis of vast datasets, facilitate faster identification of drug targets, optimization of compounds, and prediction of clinical outcomes. This review explores the multifaceted applications of AI across various stages of cancer drug development, from early-stage discovery to clinical trial design, development. In early-stage discovery, AI-driven methods support target identification, virtual screening (VS), and molecular docking, offering precise predictions that streamline the identification of promising compounds. Additionally, AI is instrumental in de novo drug design and lead optimization, where algorithms can generate novel molecular structures and optimize their properties to enhance drug efficacy and safety profiles. Preclinical development benefits from AI's predictive modeling capabilities, particularly in assessing a drug's toxicity through in silico simulations. AI also plays a pivotal role in biomarker discovery, enabling the identification of specific molecular signatures that can inform patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. In clinical development, AI optimizes trial design by leveraging real-world data (RWD), improving patient selection, and reducing the time required to bring new drugs to market. Despite its transformative potential, challenges remain, including issues related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these limitations is critical for fully realizing AI's potential in cancer drug discovery and development. As AI continues to evolve, its integration with other technologies, such as genomics and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI's impact on the cancer drug discovery and development and highlights future directions for this rapidly evolving field.}

abstract = {Objectives
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare offers opportunities for improving patient care, yet successful implementation relies on patient acceptance. Understanding how patients perceive AI technologies in healthcare is critical for developing strategies that address their concerns while leveraging perceived benefits. This scoping review, the first comprehensive synthesis of patient concerns across diverse healthcare contexts, aims to systematically identify and synthesize evidence regarding patients’ perceptions of AI in healthcare, including perceived benefits, concerns, and factors influencing acceptance.
Methods
Following PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA for scoping reviews) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for empirical studies published between January 2014 and June 2024. The review identified 38 studies meeting eligibility criteria. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, AI applications, healthcare domains, and patient-reported perceptions organized into thematic categories.
Results
The scoping review identified 38 studies across 18 countries, with over 75% of patients expressing notable benefits of AI in healthcare, including improved diagnostic accuracy (particularly in medical imaging), enhanced efficiency, time savings, and personalized care. However, approximately 50–70% of patients had substantial concerns about the loss of human connection in healthcare delivery, reliability, and safety uncertainties, privacy and data security risks, and issues with trust, transparency, and patient autonomy. Acceptance factors clustered into demographic factors (age, education, digital literacy), health condition specifics, clinical involvement models, and organizational/systemic factors. An integrated framework illustrating the multifaceted nature of patient acceptance of AI in healthcare is proposed.
Conclusions
Patient acceptance of AI encompasses a complex interplay of individual characteristics, technology design features, healthcare contextual factors and systemic considerations. The insights of this scoping review call for human-centric AI design and regulatory frameworks prioritizing patient autonomy. Successful implementation strategies should maintain human oversight, ensure transparent communication about AI capabilities and limitations, tailor approaches to specific contexts, and engage patients as stakeholders in development and implementation. Future research should explore diverse cultural contexts and develop interventions to enhance patient education and engagement with healthcare AI.}

Within this article, we aim to discuss the three pillars central to a trainee’s experience including education on AI, AI education tools, and clinical implementation of AI. An already overcrowded clinical residency curricula makes little room for a thorough AI education, the challenge of which may be overcome through longitudinal distinct educational tracks during residency or external courses offered through a variety of societies. In addition to teaching the fundamentals of AI, programs that offer education tools using AI will improve on antiquated clinical curricula. These education tools are a growing field in research and industry offering a variety of unique opportunities to promote active inquiry, improved comprehension, and overall clinical competence. The near 700 FDA-approved AI clinical tools almost guarantee that residents will be exposed to this technology, which may have mixed effects on education, although more research needs to be done to further elucidate this challenge. Ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias, liability, and postdeployment monitoring, highlight the need for structured instruction and mentorship. As AI continues to evolve, residency programs must prioritize evidence-based, adaptable curricula to prepare future radiologists to critically assess, use, and contribute to AI advancements, ensuring that these tools complement rather than undermine clinical expertise.}

Deep learning (DL) for neuroimaging can improve early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Clinical implementation of DL faces challenges in accurately representing real-world data. Recent models, particularly those focused on diagnostic categorization, have achieved high accuracy, but their applicability to patients is limited. Conflicting inferences have been reported, with findings from small cohorts generalizing conclusions without considering inter-scanner, intra- and inter-site variations. A theoretically feasible method involves gathering a comprehensive dataset that encompasses all patient demographics, but this presents practical challenges including harmonization, data incompleteness, class imbalance, and substantial costs. Existing research has also mostly focused on common NDDs like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). This contribution expands the literature by looking at a wider range of NDDs, exploring the latest advancements in applying deep learning algorithms to neuroimaging analysis for the diagnosis and monitoring of NDDs, including AD, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Lewy Body Dementia, PD, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Multiple Sclerosis. We emphasize how these approaches are handling spatial/temporal information available in brain volume imaging data. We conclude by discussing the challenges associated with the use of voxel-based, patch-based, ROI-based, and slice-based approaches in brain volume imaging. These challenges are further compounded by issues such as inter-site and inter-scanner variability, class imbalances in medical datasets, and the scarcity of accurately annotated data, all of which impact the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.}

Current methods for cleaning, creating, accessing, extracting, augmenting, and representing data for training AI clinical prediction models are well defined. The use of AI to predict clinical outcomes is a dynamic and rapidly evolving arena, with new methods and applications emerging. Extraction or accession of electronic health care records and combining these with patient genetic data is an area of present attention, with tremendous potential for future growth. Machine learning approaches, including decision tree methods of Random Forest and XGBoost, and deep learning techniques including deep multi-layer and recurrent neural networks, afford unique capabilities to accurately create predictions from high dimensional, multimodal data. Furthermore, AI methods are increasing our ability to accurately predict clinical outcomes that previously were difficult to model, including time-dependent and multi-class outcomes. Barriers to robust AI-based clinical outcome model deployment include changing AI product development interfaces, the specificity of regulation requirements, and limitations in ensuring model interpretability, generalizability, and adaptability over time.}

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and currently the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an important tool to improve clinical management of HCC, including for diagnosis, prognostication and evaluation of treatment response. Different AI approaches, such as machine learning and deep learning, are both based on the concept of developing prediction algorithms from large amounts of data, or big data. The era of digital medicine has led to a rapidly expanding amount of routinely collected health data which can be leveraged for the development of AI models. Various studies have constructed AI models by using features extracted from ultrasound imaging, computed tomography imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Most of these models have used convolutional neural networks. These tools have shown promising results for HCC detection, characterization of liver lesions and liver/tumor segmentation. Regarding treatment, studies have outlined a role for AI in evaluation of treatment response and improvement of pre-treatment planning. Several challenges remain to fully integrate AI models in clinical practice. Future research is still needed to robustly evaluate AI algorithms in prospective trials, and improve interpretability, generalizability and transparency. If such challenges can be overcome, AI has the potential to profoundly change the management of patients with HCC. The purpose of this review was to sum up current evidence on AI approaches using imaging for the clinical management of HCC.}

AI-assisted algorithms have notably improved decision-making, operational efficiency, and productivity, especially in healthcare and medicine. However, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the integration of medical AI has faced delays and challenges, slowing its acceptance and implementation in medical interventions. This thematic narrative critically explores the current trends and patterns in applying medical AI in SSA, with a specific focus on its potential impact on medical laboratories. The review covers the general use of medical AI in SSA, examining factors like enablers, challenges, and opportunities that influence healthcare systems. Additionally, it looks into the implications of medical AI for medical laboratories and suggests context-specific and practical recommendations for potential integration. We highlight various challenges, including data availability, security concerns, resource limitations, regulatory gaps, poor internet connectivity, and digital literacy issues, contributing to the slow integration of AI in healthcare systems in SSA. Despite challenges, the adoption of medical AI in SSA medical laboratories holds latent potential for improving diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and enhancing patient care. Further exploration and careful consideration are necessary to unlock these possibilities.}

In addition, dramatic investment from the web giants has fostered the development of a high-quality software stack. Going forward, the combination of faster computers with dedicated software libraries and the widespread availability of data has opened the door to more flexibility in the design of AI models. Radiomics is a process used to discover new imaging biomarkers that has multiple applications in radiology and can be used in conjunction with AI. AI can be used throughout the various processes of diagnostic imaging, including data acquisition, reconstruction, analysis and reporting. Today, the concept of “AI-augmented” radiologists is preferred to the theory of the replacement of radiologists by AI in many indications. Current evidence bolsters the assumption that AI-assisted radiologists work better and faster. Interventional radiology becomes a data-rich specialty where the entire procedure is fully recorded in a standardized DICOM format and accessible via standard picture archiving and communication systems. No other interventional specialty can bolster such readiness. In this setting, interventional radiology could lead the development of AI-powered applications in the broader interventional community. This article provides an update on the current status of radiomics and AI research, analyzes upcoming challenges and also discusses the main applications in AI in interventional radiology to help radiologists better understand and criticize articles reporting AI in medical imaging.}

Cancer is a lethal disease with many etiologies, including numerous genetic and epigenetic mutations. Cancer being a multifactorial disease is difficult to be diagnosed at an early stage. Therefore, genetic variations and other leading factors could be identified in due time through AI and machine learning (ML). AI is the synergetic approach for mining the drug targets, their mechanism of action, and drug-organism interaction from massive raw data. This synergetic approach is also facing several challenges in data mining but computational algorithms from different scientific communities for multi-target drug discovery are highly helpful to overcome the bottlenecks in AI for drug-target discovery. AI and ML could be the epicenter in the medical world for the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of almost any disease in the near future. In this comprehensive review, we explore the immense potential of AI and ML when integrated with the biological sciences, specifically in the context of cancer research. Our goal is to illuminate the many ways in which AI and ML are being applied to the study of cancer, from diagnosis to individualized treatment. We highlight the prospective role of AI in supporting oncologists and other medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes by examining the intersection of AI and cancer control.

Clinical routine in hepatology involves the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of metabolic, infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Clinicians integrate qualitative and quantitative information from multiple data sources to make a diagnosis, prognosticate the disease course, and recommend a treatment. In the last 5 years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning, have made it possible to extract clinically relevant information from complex and diverse clinical datasets. In particular, histopathology and radiology image data contain diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information which AI can extract. Ultimately, such AI systems could be implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, in the context of hepatology, this requires further large-scale clinical validation and regulatory approval. Herein, we summarise the state of the art in AI in hepatology with a particular focus on histopathology and radiology data. We present a roadmap for the further development of novel biomarkers in hepatology and outline critical obstacles which need to be overcome.}

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the application of computer systems to tasks traditionally performed by humans. The medical imaging profession has experienced a transformative shift through the integration of AI. While there have been several independent primary studies describing various aspects of AI, the current review employs a systematic approach towards describing the perspectives of radiologists and radiographers about the integration of AI in clinical practice. This review provides a holistic view from a professional standpoint towards understanding how the broad spectrum of AI tools are perceived as a unit in medical imaging practice.
Methods
The study utilised a systematic review approach to collect data from quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed articles concentrating on the viewpoints of either radiographers or radiologists regarding the incorporation of AI in medical imaging practice. A stepwise approach was employed in the systematic search across various databases. The included studies underwent quality assessment using the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSSD) checklist. A parallel-result convergent synthesis approach was employed to independently synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence and to integrate the findings during the discussion phase.
Results
Forty-one articles were included, all of which employed a cross-sectional study design. The main findings were themed around considerations and perspectives relating to AI education, impact on image quality and radiation dose, ethical and medico-legal implications for the use of AI, patient considerations and their perceived significance of AI for their care, and factors that influence development, implementation and job security. Despite varying emphasis, these themes collectively provide a global perspective on AI in medical imaging practice.
Conclusion
While expertise levels are varied and different, both radiographers and radiologists were generally optimistic about incorporation of AI in medical imaging practice. However, low levels of AI education and knowledge remain a critical barrier. Furthermore, equipment errors, cost, data security and operational difficulties, ethical constraints, job displacement concerns and insufficient implementation efforts are integration challenges that should merit the attention of stakeholders.
RÉSUMÉ
Introduction
L'intelligence artificielle (IA) représente l'application de systèmes informatiques à des tâches traditionnellement effectuées par des humains. L'intégration de l'IA a transformé la profession d'imagerie médicale. Bien qu'il y ait eu plusieurs études primaires indépendantes décrivant divers aspects de l'IA, la présente analyse utilise une approche systématique pour décrire les points de vue des radiologues et des radiographes sur l'intégration de l'IA dans la pratique clinique. Cet examen fournit une vue holistique d'un point de vue professionnel pour comprendre comment le large spectre des outils d'IA est perçu comme un tout dans la pratique de l'imagerie médicale.
Méthodologie
Nous avons utilisé une approche d'examen systématique pour recueillir des données provenant d'études quantitatives, qualitatives et de méthodes mixtes. Les critères d'inclusion comprenaient les articles se concentrant sur les points de vue des radiographes ou des radiologues concernant l'incorporation de l'IA dans la pratique de l'imagerie médicale. Une approche progressive a été utilisée pour la recherche systématique dans diverses bases de données. Les études incluses ont fait l'objet d'une évaluation de la qualité à l'aide de la liste de contrôle QATSSD (Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs). Une approche de synthèse convergente à résultats parallèles a été employée pour synthétiser indépendamment les preuves qualitatives et quantitatives et pour intégrer les résultats au cours de la phase de discussion.
Résultats
Quarante et un articles ont été retenus, qui ont tous utilisé un modèle d'étude transversale. Les principaux résultats s'articulent autour de considérations et de perspectives relatives à la formation à l'IA, à l'incidence sur la qualité de l'image et la dose de rayonnement, aux implications éthiques et médico-légales de l'utilisation de l'IA, aux considérations des patients et à leur perception de l'importance de l'IA pour leurs soins, ainsi qu'aux facteurs qui influencent le développement, la mise en œuvre et la sécurité d'emploi. Malgré une importance variable, ces thèmes offrent collectivement une perspective globale sur l'IA dans la pratique de l'imagerie médicale.
Conclusion
Bien que les niveaux d'expertise soient variés et différents, les radiographes et les radiologues sont généralement optimistes quant à l'intégration de l'IA dans la pratique de l'imagerie médicale. Cependant, les faibles niveaux de formation et de connaissances en matière d'IA restent un obstacle majeur. En outre, les erreurs d'équipement, le coût, la sécurité des données et les difficultés opérationnelles, les contraintes éthiques, les problèmes de déplacement d'emplois et l'insuffisance des efforts de mise en œuvre sont des défis d'intégration qui devraient mériter l'attention des intervenants.}

This review explored the emerging role of AI in the individualized management of rectal cancer, with a focus on its potential to improve treatment outcomes and patient prognosis. Herein, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent studies investigating AI applications in predicting pathological complete response, metastasis, and disease-free survival following neoadjuvant therapy. These studies employ diverse data modalities, including radiomics (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and endoscopy), clinical parameters, and other omics-based features. The study evaluated the predictive models developed using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, discussing their performance metrics, strengths, and limitations. Despite the ongoing challenges—such as limited data availability, lack of model interpretability, and suboptimal predictive accuracy—AI has demonstrated potential to outperform conventional assessment methods in select areas.

This review updates the exponentially increasing literature exploring the diagnostic value of endometriosis specialist transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS), combinations of eTVUS and specialist magnetic resonance imaging, and artificial intelligence. Concentrating on literature that emerged after the publication of the IDEA consensus in 2016, we identified 6192 publications and reviewed 49 studies focused on diagnosing endometriosis using emerging imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of eTVUS continues to improve but there are still limitations. eTVUS reliably detects ovarian endometriomas, shows high specificity for deep endometriosis and should be considered diagnostic. However, a negative scan cannot preclude endometriosis as eTVUS shows moderate sensitivity scores for deep endometriosis, with the sonographic evaluation of superficial endometriosis still in its infancy. The fast-growing area of artificial intelligence in endometriosis detection is still evolving, but shows great promise, particularly in the area of combined multimodal techniques. We finalize our commentary by exploring the implications of practice change for surgeons, sonographers, radiologists, and fertility specialists. Direct benefits for endometriosis patients include reduced diagnostic delay, better access to targeted therapeutics, higher quality operative procedures, and improved fertility treatment plans.}

abstract = {Background
Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with approximately 15 million people suffering strokes annually. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for stroke prediction, enabling early identification of risk factors through data-driven approaches. However, the clinical utility and performance characteristics of these approaches require systematic evaluation.
Objectives
To systematically review and analyze ML techniques used for stroke prediction, systematically synthesize performance metrics across different prediction targets and data sources, evaluate their clinical applicability, and identify research trends focusing on patient population characteristics and stroke prevalence patterns.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Five databases (Google Scholar, Lens, PubMed, ResearchGate, and Semantic Scholar) were searched for open-access publications on ML-based stroke prediction published between January 2013 and December 2024. Data were extracted on publication characteristics, datasets, ML methodologies, evaluation metrics, prediction targets (stroke occurrence vs. outcomes), data sources (EHR, imaging, biosignals), patient demographics, and stroke prevalence. Descriptive synthesis was performed due to substantial heterogeneity precluding quantitative meta-analysis.
Results
Fifty-eight studies were included, with peak publication output in 2021 (21 articles). Studies targeted three main prediction objectives: stroke occurrence prediction (n = 52, 62.7 %), stroke outcome prediction (n = 19, 22.9 %), and stroke type classification (n = 12, 14.4 %). Data sources included electronic health records (n = 48, 57.8 %), medical imaging (n = 21, 25.3 %), and biosignals (n = 14, 16.9 %). Systematic analysis revealed ensemble methods consistently achieved highest accuracies for stroke occurrence prediction (range: 90.4–97.8 %), while deep learning excelled in imaging-based applications. African populations, despite highest stroke mortality rates globally, were represented in fewer than 4 studies.
Conclusion
ML techniques show promising results for stroke prediction. However, significant gaps exist in representation of high-risk populations and real-world clinical validation. Future research should prioritize population-specific model development and clinical implementation frameworks.}

Segmentation of anatomical tissues (teeth, root canals, jaws, etc.) in CT data is a prerequisite for treatment planning and computer-aided detection and diagnosis. While the complexity of CT imaging characteristics and oral physiology makes it difficult to extract target boundaries. This paper systematic reviews 145 articles on dental CT image segmentation. The segmentation method is categorized into classical and deep learning-based algorithms, then a new classification framework of classical algorithms is presented, which includes morphology feature-based, contour feature-based, and pixel feature-based segmentation algorithms. We perform a literature clustering analysis, dissect the algorithm from the perspective of classical to deep learning trend, and compare the characteristics, performance and applications of various algorithm. The applicability and limitations of classic algorithms are further expounded, and the development direction of the deep learning-based algorithm from several aspects of training sample, network structure, execution method and training strategy. Oral tissue segmentation is an unresolved topic due to the limitations of existing approaches, in which deep learning algorithms, the mainstream future direction, are already comparable to manual segmentation, yet there is still room for improvement. Finally, we identified promising research directions, that is the high-quality samples, multi-algorithm integration, performance balance and multi-modal imaging, and an image application framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the whole cycle of dental treatment is proposed.

Relevant articles were identified from their titles had their abstracts evaluated, and those deemed relevant had their full text reviewed. Extracted data from selected studies included the application of AI, radiation dose, anatomical part, and any relevant evaluation metrics based on the CT parameter in which AI is applied.
Results
90 articles met the selection criteria. Included studies evaluated the performance of AI for dose optimisation through patient positioning, scan range determination, and reconstruction across various CT scans, including the abdomen, chest, head, neck, and pelvis, as well as CT angiography. A concise overview of the present state of AI in these three domains, emphasising benefits, limitations, and impact on the transformation of dose reduction in CT scanning, is provided.
Conclusions
AI methods can help minimise positioning offsets and over-scanning caused by manual errors and helped to overcome the limitation associated with low-dose CT settings through deep learning image reconstruction algorithms. Further clinical integration of AI will continue to allow for improvements in optimising CT scan protocols and radiation dose.
Implications for practice

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) assessment have emerged across multiple analytical tasks, yet comprehensive evidence synthesis remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated AI-assisted hip ultrasonography performance across segmentation, angle measurement, and diagnostic classification tasks in infants.
Materials and Methods
Following PROSPERO registration (CRD420251133940), we searched Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies reporting AI performance for DDH ultrasonographic evaluation were included. Quality assessment employed QUADAS-2 and CLAIM checklists. Random-effects meta-analyses synthesized Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) for segmentation, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) for angle measurements, and diagnostic accuracy metrics. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics and prediction intervals.
Results
Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Segmentation performance (7 studies, n=3011) yielded pooled DSC of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.827–0.924). Angle measurement reliability (4 studies, n=2012) demonstrated pooled ICC of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.763–0.945) for alpha angles and 0.864 (95% CI: 0.653–0.951) for beta angles. Diagnostic classification showed pooled AUC of 0.937 (95% CI: 0.885–0.966) across 5 studies (n=3035), with pooled sensitivity 0.888 (95% CI: 0.840–0.923) and specificity 0.893 (95% CI: 0.735–0.961) from 10 studies (n=5341). Substantial heterogeneity (I²>75%) was observed across all domains. CLAIM adherence averaged 67.9%, with critical gaps in external validation (20.6%).
Conclusion
AI-assisted hip ultrasonography demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks, supporting potential clinical application. However, high heterogeneity, limited external validation, and reporting deficiencies necessitate standardization before clinical deployment.}

abstract = {Historically, South Africa, a developing country, has battled numerous chronic diseases such as Cancer, Diabetes, and Tuberculosis. Even though significant efforts are made in the medical diagnostic industry to detect and treat these chronic diseases, these efforts have fallen short due to their higher diagnostic costs, shortage in infrastructure, equipment, and highly skilled technicians at the required time, resulting in reduced access to healthcare for patients. In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based medical diagnosis has gained prominence because of its low cost, less infrastructure, equipment, and technician requirements. In addition, AI-based medical diagnosis reduces diagnostic time with a significantly high level of accuracy. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of 32 collated AI articles. We, present our findings, and scope the tools, techniques, and algorithms from a South African Context. The scope of this literature review involves (1) conducting an attribute analysis of literature that includes studying disease, temporal, and spatial aspects of literature as well as stages in developing AI-based medical diagnosis tool; (2) conducting a conceptual analysis of literature that includes studying applications, algorithms, techniques, and performance measures related to different AI stages; and (3) scoping the insights from the literature from a South African context that involves proposing a framework for developing AI-based medical diagnostic tool, hardware and software requirements, and deployment strategies into underdeveloped medical diagnostic provinces of South Africa.}

This convergence enables more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatment strategies, and real-time patient monitoring, ultimately transforming healthcare from reactive to predictive and preventive. Additionally, MMAI can lead to improved operational efficiency by enabling automated reporting and streamlining clinical workflows, helping to reduce clinician burnout and accelerate diagnostic turnaround times. Despite significant advancements, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of MMAI, including data fragmentation, interoperability issues, computational demands, and the need for explainable AI in clinical decision-making. This opinion paper explores four key aspects driving the future of MMAI in healthcare: (1) the evolution of multimodal data; (2) advancements in AI models and fusion strategies for extracting insights from heterogeneous data streams; (3) major challenges such as synchronization across modalities, interpretability, and regulatory constraints; and (4) emerging future directions, including the role of digital twins, automated clinical reporting, and precision medicine.}

The review covers empirical studies published between 2021 and 2023, focusing on high-quality sources. An initial pool of 997 entries was screened across multiple databases, yielding 928 unique articles after duplicate removal. Ultimately, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in depth. The quality assessment confirmed that all selected reviews adhered to established methodological standards. The key findings show XAI's broad uses, which range from increasing trust and transparency to assisting with financial and management decision-making. The prevalence of healthcare-focused studies emphasizes XAI's importance in enhancing interpretability, fairness, regulatory compliance, and personalized treatment options. Commonly used techniques include visual explanation tools, interpretable machine learning models, and model-agnostic approaches. While the review offers valuable insights, it acknowledges limitations such as its reliance on Q1 journals and the exclusion of broader sources, which may affect comprehensiveness. To advance the field, the study recommends expanding future research to underrepresented domains like autonomous vehicles, defense, and smart cities. It also calls for methodological innovation to enhance accessibility, fairness, privacy, and the development of intuitive explanation strategies. Addressing these gaps can significantly improve the trustworthiness and effectiveness of AI systems across sectors.}

However, these models often lack transparency, and their black-box nature limits clinical trust and broader adoption. Although existing reviews have explored the application of explainable AI (XAI) in pathology, most use incomplete or inconsistent taxonomies and lack evaluation frameworks that consider multiple dimensions. The lack of a clear taxonomy and evaluation framework makes it difficult to compare results, identify suitable approaches, and assess the strengths and limitations of XAI methods from multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, this review presents a taxonomy from five perspectives and introduces the PathXAI-2 L minimal evaluation framework. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive overview of key tasks in pathological image analysis, commonly used datasets and their biases, and preprocessing strategies, algorithmic frameworks, and evaluation metrics. Based on this foundation, it proposes a five-dimensional taxonomy of XAI methods, organized by model dependency, explanation scope, explanation stage, explanatory modality, and evidential strength. The evidence perspective is used to distinguish between correlation and causality, by grouping explanations into association, sensitivity, and intervention levels. This review further examines two important factors influencing explainability results: the sensitivity of XAI methods to dataset choice, and the role of external resources in supporting explanations. At the technical level, this review groups XAI methods into seven representative types and introduces XAI tools in pathology. Finally, it proposes a minimal evaluation framework called PathXAI-2 L, focused on the functional and human layers, while highlighting key challenges and future directions for application-grounded evaluation. By integrating tasks, datasets, methods, and evaluation strategies, this review provides a comprehensive reference for advancing both technical progress and clinical impact in pathology XAI.}

In interstitial lung diseases, technologies have been developed that use AI to analyze high-resolution computed tomography and pathological images, and gene expression patterns in tissue taken from transbronchial lung biopsies to assist in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Some of these technologies are already being used in clinical practice in the United States. AI is expected to reduce the burden on physicians, improve reproducibility, and advance personalized medicine. Obtaining sufficient data for diseases with a small number of patients is difficult. Additionally, certain issues must be addressed in order for AI to be applied in healthcare. These issues include taking responsibility for the AI results output, updating software after the launch of technology, and adapting to new imaging technologies. Establishing research infrastructures such as large-scale databases and common platforms is important for the development of AI technology: their use requires an understanding of the characteristics and limitations of the systems.

There are even instances where deep learning outperformed humans, for example with object recognition and gaming. Deep learning is also showing vast potential in the medical domain. With the collection of large quantities of patient records and data, and a trend towards personalized treatments, there is a great need for automated and reliable processing and analysis of health information. Patient data is not only collected in clinical centers, like hospitals and private practices, but also by mobile healthcare apps or online websites. The abundance of collected patient data and the recent growth in the deep learning field has resulted in a large increase in research efforts. In Q2/2020, the search engine PubMed returned already over 11,000 results for the search term ‘deep learning’, and around 90% of these publications are from the last three years. However, even though PubMed represents the largest search engine in the medical field, it does not cover all medical-related publications. Hence, a complete overview of the field of ‘medical deep learning’ is almost impossible to obtain and acquiring a full overview of medical sub-fields is becoming increasingly more difficult. Nevertheless, several review and survey articles about medical deep learning have been published within the last few years. They focus, in general, on specific medical scenarios, like the analysis of medical images containing specific pathologies.

Statistical records show that early detection of malaria parasites could prevent deaths and machine learning (ML) has proved helpful in the early detection of malarial parasites. Human error is identified to be a major cause of inaccurate diagnostics in the traditional microscopy malaria diagnosis method. Therefore, the method would be more reliable if human expert dependency is restricted or entirely removed, and thus, the motivation of this paper. This study presents a systematic review to understand the prevalent machine learning algorithms applied to a low-cost, portable optical microscope in the automation of blood film interpretation for malaria parasite detection. Peer-reviewed papers were downloaded from selected reputable databases eg.

The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) criteria provide an important framework for evaluating treatment efficacy and tumour progression in clinical studies of paediatric brain tumours. As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly transforms clinical practice, integrating AI into the RAPNO framework presents a unique opportunity to enhance quantitative, data-driven approaches for response assessment. However, successful clinical implementation faces challenges, including variability in imaging protocols, scarce annotated datasets, and regulatory and ethical considerations. To address these barriers, this Policy Review, led by the AI for Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (AI-RAPNO) subcommittee, outlines key challenges and proposes recommendations to improve AI trustworthiness, generalisability, and implementation in paediatric neuro-oncology. We highlight the potential of AI for response assessment, multimodal integration, and synthetic control groups in clinical trials. Our recommendations emphasise the need for standardised imaging protocols, robust validation frameworks, and infrastructure to support AI readiness in clinical studies. By addressing these needs, AI-RAPNO aims to bridge the gap between AI research and clinical application, ensuring reliable and actionable AI-driven tools for paediatric neuro-oncology.}

abstract = {Computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) are two crucial subsets of artificial intelligence (AI). Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant application of deep learning (DL) in NLP. LLMs are AI systems with transformer architectures trained on large-scale datasets that are capable of understanding and generating natural language. LLMs have been widely applied in tasks such as text generation and translation. In dermatology, LLMs have been used for various purposes, such as diagnostic assistance, medical practice and decision support, patient communication, and professional education. However, dermatology differs from other medical specialties in that the diagnosis of diseases, selection of treatment methods, and prediction of prognoses rely heavily on the recognition of visual patterns. Therefore, in dermatology, LLMs must simultaneously process dermatological images and natural language. The aim of this study was to systematically review NLP and CV applications of LLMs in dermatology. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the applications of LLMs in dermatological NLP and image processing tasks were systematically reviewed. After searching the MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, and Scopus databases, a total of 38 original studies were included. The results show that, in NLP tasks, LLMs have demonstrated satisfactory performance in some studies, but most image processing results are not ideal. This review summarizes the research findings on the applications of LLMs in dermatological natural language and image analysis, aiming to identify LLMs capable of simultaneously processing both text and images as a direction for future development.}

Traditional risk stratification, primarily based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other coarse metrics, often fails to identify a large subset of patients at risk and frequently leads to unnecessary device implantations. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new strategies to improve both long-term SCD risk prediction and near-term VAs forecasting. In this review, we discuss how AI algorithms applied to the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can identify subtle risk markers in conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and coronary artery disease (CAD), often outperforming conventional risk models. We also explore the integration of AI with cardiac imaging, such as scar quantification on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and fibrosis mapping, to enhance the identification of the arrhythmogenic substrate. Furthermore, we investigate the application of data from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and wearable devices to predict ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) events before they occur, thereby advancing care toward real-time prevention. Amid these innovations, we address the medicolegal and ethical implications of AI-driven automated alerts in arrhythmia care, highlighting when clinicians can trust AI predictions. Future directions include multimodal AI fusion to personalize SCD risk assessment, as well as AI-guided VT ablation planning through imaging-based digital heart models.

abstract = {Background
Fatty liver disease, encompassing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), affects ∼25% of adults globally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly proton density fat fraction (PDFF), is the non-invasive gold standard for hepatic steatosis quantification, but its clinical use is limited by cost, protocol variability, a analysis time. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), show promise in enhancing MRI-based quantification and staging.
Objective
To systematically review the diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical utility of ML and DL techniques applied to MRI for quantifying and staging hepatic steatosis in fatty liver disease.
Methods
This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251121056) and adhered to PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature for studies on ML/DL applications in MRI for fatty liver disease. Eligible studies involved human participants with suspected/confirmed NAFLD, NASH, or ALD, using ML/DL (e.g., CNNs, GANs) on MRI data (e.g., PDFF, Dixon MRI). Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC)), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Dice), and clinical utility (e.g., treatment planning). Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2. Narrative synthesis and meta-analysis (where feasible) were conducted.
Results
From 2550 records, 15 studies (n = 25–1038) were included, using CNNs, GANs, radiomics, and dictionary learning on PDFF, chemical shift-encoded MRI, or Dixon MRI. Diagnostic accuracy was high (AUC 0.85–0.97, r = 0.94–0.99 vs. biopsy/MRS), with reproducibility metrics robust (ICC 0.94–0.99, Dice 0.87–0.94). Efficiency improved significantly (e.g., processing <0.16 s/slice, scan time <1 min). Clinical utility included virtual biopsies, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Limitations included small sample sizes, single-center designs, and vendor variability.
Conclusion
ML and DL enhance MRI-based hepatic steatosis assessment, offering high accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency. CNNs excel in segmentation/PDFF quantification, while GANs and radiomics aid free-breathing MRI and NASH staging. Multi-center studies and standardization are needed for clinical integration.
Résumé
Contexte
La maladie hépatique, qui englobe la maladie du foie associée à un dysfonctionnement métabolique (MASLD) et la maladie hépatique alcoolique (ALD), touche environ 25% des adultes dans le monde. L'imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM), en particulier la fraction de graisse en densité protonique (PDFF), est la référence non invasive pour la quantification de la stéatose hépatique, mais son utilisation clinique est limitée par son coût, la variabilité des protocoles et le temps d'analyse. Les techniques d'apprentissage automatique (ML) et d'apprentissage profond (DL), notamment les réseaux neuronaux convolutifs (CNN) et les réseaux antagonistes génératifs (GAN), semblent prometteuses pour améliorer la quantification et la stadification basées sur l'IRM.
Objectif
Examiner de manière systématique la précision diagnostique, la reproductibilité et l'utilité clinique des techniques ML et DL appliquées à l'IRM pour quantifier et stadifier la stéatose dans la maladie hépatique.
Méthodologie
Cette revue systématique a été enregistrée dans PROSPERO (CRD420251121056) et respecte les directives PRISMA. Les recherches ont été faites dans PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Google Scholar et la littérature grise des études sur les applications du ML/DL en IRM pour les maladies du foie. Les études admissibles portaient sur des participants humains présentant une MASLD, une NASH ou une ALD suspectée/confirmée, utilisant le ML/DL (par exemple, CNN, GAN) sur des données IRM (par exemple, PDFF, IRM Dixon). Les résultats comprenaient la précision diagnostique (sensibilité, spécificité, aire sous la courbe (AUC)), la reproductibilité (coefficient de corrélation intraclasse (ICC), Dice) et l'utilité clinique (par exemple, planification du traitement). Deux évaluateurs ont examiné les études, extrait les données et évalué le risque de biais à l'aide du QUADAS-2. Une synthèse narrative et une méta-analyse (lorsque cela était possible) ont été réalisées.
Résultats
Sur 2 550 enregistrements, 15 études (n = 25-1 038) ont été incluses, utilisant des CNN, des GAN, la radiomique et l'apprentissage de dictionnaires sur PDFF, IRM codée par déplacement chimique ou IRM Dixon. La précision diagnostique était élevée (AUC 0,85-0,97, r = 0,94-0,99 par rapport à la biopsie/MRS), avec des mesures de reproductibilité robustes (ICC 0,94-0,99, Dice 0,87-0,94). L'efficacité s'est considérablement améliorée (par exemple, traitement < 0,16 s/coupe, temps de scan < 1 min). L'utilité clinique comprenait les biopsies virtuelles, la planification chirurgicale et le suivi du traitement. Les limites comprenaient la petite taille des échantillons, les conceptions monocentriques et la variabilité des fournisseurs.
Conclusion
Le ML et le DL améliorent l'évaluation de la stéatose hépatique par IRM, offrant une grande précision, reproductibilité et efficacité. Les CNN excellent dans la segmentation/quantification PDFF, tandis que les GAN et la radiomique facilitent l'IRM à respiration libre et la stadification de la NASH. Des études multicentriques et une normalisation sont nécessaires pour l'intégration clinique.}

However, the anatomical complexity of PNs, coupled with their proximity to surrounding structures like vessels and muscles, presents significant challenges. Advanced imaging techniques, including MR-neurography and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) neurography, have shown promise but are hindered by steep learning curves, operator dependency, and limited accessibility. Discrepancies between imaging findings and patient symptoms further complicate the evaluation of PNs, particularly in cases where imaging appears normal despite clinical indications of pathology. Additionally, demographic and clinical factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and physical activity influence PN health but remain unquantifiable with current imaging methods. Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions have emerged as a transformative tool in PN evaluation. AI-based algorithms offer the potential to transition from qualitative to quantitative assessments, enabling precise segmentation, characterization, and threshold determination to distinguish healthy from pathological nerves. These advances could improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring. This review highlights the latest advances in AI applications for PN imaging, discussing their potential to overcome the current limitations and opportunities to improve their integration into routine radiological practice.}

This narrative review explores the development, utility, and implementation challenges of FMs in U.S. radiology. Literature from PubMed, Scopus, arXiv, and IEEE Xplore (January 2022 to May 2025) was synthesized to highlight architectural trends, clinical applications, evaluation methods, and regulatory developments. U.S.-based models like CheXzero, BioMedCLIP, and Med-PaLM demonstrate strong diagnostic and reporting performance but face key limitations—including lack of FDA clearance, limited external validation, and integration barriers with PACS/RIS systems. Safety issues such as hallucination, automation bias, and underperformance in edge cases persist. While human-in-the-loop frameworks, federated learning, and emerging reporting standards show promise, institutional readiness and regulatory clarity remain fragmented. We propose a roadmap that includes continuous monitoring, equity-focused design, and a national FM registry to guide responsible deployment. Radiology’s digital maturity makes it a critical testbed for foundational AI integration—offering lessons for broader clinical adoption.}

This paper reviews the use of AI-based approaches in COPD diagnosis by using three primary types of datasets: text data, such as clinical notes and electronic health records; audio data, including lung sounds, cough signals, and so on; and image data from chest X-rays and CT scans. Discussing the use of deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, in analyzing images, we identify how these networks can successfully classify COPD cases along with the level of severity. The potential of AI models in COPD diagnostics is very promising, though there are areas of challenges like data standardization, model generalizability, and interpretability.

Although a plethora of research articles on AI methods on COVID-19 medical imaging are published, their clinical value remains unclear. We conducted the largest systematic review of the literature addressing the utility of AI in imaging for COVID-19 patient care. By keyword searches on PubMed and preprint servers throughout 2020, we identified 463 manuscripts and performed a systematic meta-analysis to assess their technical merit and clinical relevance. Our analysis evidences a significant disparity between clinical and AI communities, in the focus on both imaging modalities (AI experts neglected CT and ultrasound, favoring X-ray) and performed tasks (71.9% of AI papers centered on diagnosis). The vast majority of manuscripts were found to be deficient regarding potential use in clinical practice, but 2.7% (n = 12) publications were assigned a high maturity level and are summarized in greater detail. We provide an itemized discussion of the challenges in developing clinically relevant AI solutions with recommendations and remedies.}

abstract = {Background
In this study, we explore key mechanisms and trends in radiology operations, imaging innovations and process augmentations to establish three hypotheses for the future of radiology, framed as a strategic outlook.
Methods
The trend analysis is based on an international radiology survey on invest preferences, an analysis of five decades of imaging innovations since the 1980s, and an evaluation of the impact of recent AI advances on medical and radiological processes.
Results
The Operational Evolution hypothesis considers radiology operations going through three phases, from foundational setup through process optimization to systemic management of assets and results. The Imaging Innovation hypothesis is based on an evaluation of imaging innovations in CT, MRI, mammography and PET systems over the past five decades. The role of software increased significantly, with user-driven and automated device operations, speed of imaging procedure and accurate validated biomarkers for therapy decisions as the three key drivers. The Augmented Radiology hypothesis expects patient scheduling, the imaging procedure itself and reading and reporting processes to benefit from advances in health data integration and AI.
Discussion
Radiologists will be enabled to focus on critical cases and decisive medical decisions, while technicians are expected to be spending more time in actual patient care than device handling. As a limitation, the hypotheses only extrapolate market trends and technological advances and cannot predict the development of individual radiology organisations.
Conclusions
Continuing and accelerating software, data and AI advances will shape operations, imaging procedures and radiology processes for a more human-centered radiology.}

abstract = {Presymptomatic neurological diseases are marked by early pathological changes that occur before overt clinical symptoms. These stages, which include prodromes such as REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's or mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's, offer critical opportunities for early intervention. However, their detection remains challenging due to the subtlety of changes and the overlap with normal interindividual variability. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), offers new tools to uncover hidden signatures in complex biomedical data. First, we explore how supervised ML models can detect known prodromal patterns across diverse modalities, including EEG, cognitive scores, and structural imaging. Depending on the input, various model types — such as tree-based algorithms for structured data and convolutional or transformer networks for images and signals — can extract predictive features of early neurodegeneration. These approaches have demonstrated success in identifying at-risk individuals before clinical thresholds are reached. Yet, detecting only known patterns limits the scope of early intervention. Many individuals who will go on to develop neurological disease may not yet exhibit any recognized prodromal syndrome. Bridging this gap requires moving beyond predefined labels toward models capable of identifying subtle, unknown anomalies in individuals still considered healthy. Second, we address the detection of latent anomalies among individuals not yet considered at risk without identifiable known prodromal patterns. By mining clinical records, free-text medical notes, and population-level health databases (e.g., UK Biobank, EDS-AP–HP), and by analyzing sensor data from smartphones or wearables, AI can flag deviations from healthy patterns long before symptom onset or formal diagnosis. This approach holds promise for scalable, low-burden, ecological screening. Finally, we introduce the concept of pseudo-healthy twins — synthetic, personalized baselines generated from structural data such as MRI, to improve anomaly detection. These models predict a patient's expected healthy signal in another modality, such as PET, enabling the subtraction of normal anatomical and physiological variability to isolate disease-specific effects. Generative models like GANs and VAEs have shown promise in producing these cross-modal references, enhancing early anomaly detection in diseases like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Together, these approaches show how AI can bridge the gap between normal variation and early pathology, enabling more sensitive, personalized, and population-scalable detection of presymptomatic neurological disease.}

Le potentiel de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) en médecine réside dans sa capacité à améliorer la capacité des cliniciens à analyser les images médicales, améliorant la précision et l'exactitude diagnostiques et renforçant ainsi les tests actuels. Cependant, l'intégration de l'IA dans les soins de santé est semée de difficultés. L'hétérogénéité parmi les applications des systèmes de soins de santé, la dépendance à l'égard de logiciels propriétaires à code source fermé et les menaces croissantes en matière de cybersécurité posent des défis importants. En outre, avant d'être déployés en milieu clinique, les modèles d'IA doivent démontrer leur efficacité dans un large éventail de scénarios et être validés par des études prospectives, mais pour ce faire, il faut les tester dans un environnement reflétant le flux de travail clinique, ce qui est difficile à réaliser sans logiciel dédié. Enfin, l'utilisation de techniques d'IA dans les soins de santé soulève d'importantes questions juridiques et éthiques, telles que la protection de la vie privée des patients, la prévention des biais et le contrôle de la sécurité et de l'efficacité des dispositifs pour assurer la conformité aux réglementations. Cette étude décrit les défis posés par l'intégration de l'IA dans les soins de santé et fournit des lignes directrices sur la manière d'aller de l'avant.

Le PACS-AI peut surmonter de nombreux obstacles au déploiement de l'IA actuels et offrir une voie vers un déploiement responsable, équitable et efficace des modèles d'IA dans les soins de santé.

abstract = {Introduction
Computed tomography (CT) can evaluate thyroid cancer invasion into adjacent structures and is useful in identifying incidental thyroid nodules. Computer-aided diagnostic approaches may provide valuable clinical advantages in this domain. Here, we aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiomics and deep-learning methods using CT imaging for preoperative nodule classification.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from inception to June 2, 2025. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 and METRICS. A bivariate meta-analysis estimated pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). Two supplementary analyses compared AI model performance with radiologists and assessed diagnostic utility across CT imaging phases (plain, venous, arterial). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Deek’s funnel plot.
Results
The meta-analysis included 12 radiomics studies (sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.83, PLR: 4.60, NLR: 0.19, DOR: 30.29, AUC: 0.894) and five deep-learning studies (sensitivity: 0.87, specificity: 0.93, PLR: 14.04, NLR: 0.15, DOR: 95.76, AUC: 0.911). Radiomics models showed low heterogeneity, while deep-learning models showed substantial heterogeneity, potentially due to differences in validation, segmentation, METRICS quality, and reference standards. Overall, these models outperformed radiologists, and models using plain CT images outperformed those based on arterial or venous phases.
Conclusion
Radiomics and deep-learning models have demonstrated promising performance in classifying thyroid nodules and may improve radiologists’ accuracy in indeterminate cases, while reducing unnecessary biopsies.}

Biomarkers serve as critical molecular indicators that facilitate the early diagnosis of breast cancer, allowing for timely intervention before the disease progresses to more advanced stages. Traditional methods for biomarker discovery, including immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), have been instrumental in identifying breast cancer markers. However, these approaches often require extensive validation, are time-consuming, and may lack the ability to effectively analyze high-dimensional datasets. The rapid advancements in machine learning (ML) have transformed biomarker discovery by enabling the analysis of complex multi-omics data, integrating genomic, proteomic, and imaging datasets to identify novel biomarkers with enhanced accuracy. This study focuses on the application of ML in detecting key biomarkers COL11A1, TOP2A, MMP1, and EZH2 which are associated with tumor invasiveness, proliferation, and metastatic potential in early-stage breast cancer. These biomarkers were identified through ML-based predictive models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks, which have demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing malignant from benign cases. Our findings highlight the potential of ML-driven biomarker discovery in revolutionizing breast cancer diagnostics by improving risk stratification, enhancing predictive accuracy, and facilitating personalized treatment approaches. By leveraging AI-powered methodologies, clinicians can move toward a data-driven, precision medicine approach, ultimately reducing the burden of late-stage breast cancer diagnoses and mortality rates. However, integrating ML models into routine clinical practice requires addressing key challenges, such as data standardization, model interpretability, and validation through large-scale prospective studies. Future advancements in deep learning (DL), federated learning, and explainable AI (XAI) are expected to further refine these models, ensuring their reliability and applicability in clinical settings.}

abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 % of all lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and machine learning (ML) into NSCLC management has shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcomes. However, the impact of these technologies on patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), overall survival (OS), and cost-effectiveness remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of AI, ANNs, and ML models on PROM, OS, and cost-effectiveness in adult patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC compared to conventional research methodologies and standard-of-care approaches.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, with data synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. Data extraction focused on study design, patient characteristics, AI methodology, and outcomes of interest. Given the heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.
Results
Ten studies were included after screening 509 articles. AI-based models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic precision, treatment optimization, and predictive accuracy for survival outcomes. AI-enhanced approaches outperformed conventional statistical models in prognosis prediction and resource allocation. However, data heterogeneity, model generalizability, and algorithmic transparency remain significant challenges.
Conclusion
Current evidence supports exploratory associations between AI models and prognostic stratification for OS; there is no evaluable evidence on PROM or cost‑effectiveness in NSCLC. Future prospective studies should incorporate validated PROM and formal economic evaluation alongside clinical endpoints. AI, ANNs, and ML have the potential to revolutionize NSCLC care by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to validate their real-world clinical applicability and address potential biases, ethical implications, and concerns regarding healthcare disparities.}

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent times present revolutionary opportunities for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this condition. In this paper, we review mainly the applications of AI in CVDs with its limitations and challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can quickly and precisely analyze medical images, such as CT scans, X-rays, and ECGs, helping with early and more accurate identification of a variety of CVD diseases. To identify those who are at a high risk of getting CVD, AI models can also analyze patient data. This allows for early intervention and preventive measures. AI systems are also capable of analyzing complicated medical data to provide individualized therapy recommendations based on the requirements and traits of each patient. During patient meetings, AI-powered solutions can also help healthcare practitioners by offering real-time insights and recommendations, which may improve treatment outcomes. Machine learning (ML), which is a branch of AI and computer sciences, has also been employed to uncover complex interactions among clinical variables, leading to more accurate predictive models for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) like combining clinical data with stress test results has improved the detection of myocardial ischemia, enhancing the ability to predict future cardiovascular outcomes. In this paper, we will focus on the current AI applications in different CVDs. Also, precision medicine, and targeted therapy for these cardiovascular problems will be discussed.}

Today’s machine learning algorithms can achieve outstanding performance on an expanding variety of complex tasks–thanks to advancements in technique, the availability of enormous databases, and improved computing power. Deep learning models are at the forefront of this advancement. However, because of their nested nonlinear structure, these strong models are termed as “black boxes,” as they provide no information about how they arrive at their conclusions. Such a lack of transparencies may be unacceptable in many applications, such as the medical domain. A lot of emphasis has recently been paid to the development of methods for visualizing, explaining, and interpreting deep learning models. The situation is substantially different in safety-critical applications. The lack of transparency of machine learning techniques may be limiting or even disqualifying issue in this case. Significantly, when single bad decisions can endanger human life and health (e.g., autonomous driving, medical domain) or result in significant monetary losses (e.g., algorithmic trading), depending on an unintelligible data-driven system may not be an option. This lack of transparency is one reason why machine learning in sectors like health is more cautious than in the consumer, e-commerce, or entertainment industries. Explainability is the term introduced in the preceding years. The AI model’s black box nature will become explainable with these frameworks. Especially in the medical domain, diagnosing a particular disease through AI techniques would be less adapted for commercial use. These models’ explainable natures will help them commercially in diagnosis decisions in the medical field.

Artificial intelligence (AI) transforms dentistry and holds considerable promise for maxillofacial prosthodontics (MFP). Applications in imaging, computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and additive manufacturing are improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and prosthetic rehabilitation for patients with craniofacial abnormalities. Despite advances in materials and digital workflows, challenges remain in achieving optimal accuracy, efficiency, and customisation in prosthetic design. The integration of AI in maxillofacial prosthodontics is still in its early stages. Currently, there is no review detailing the scope, trends, potential, and limitations of AI in this field. A scoping review is therefore necessary to consolidate existing evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest directions for future research and clinical application. This review objective is to systematically map and analyse the current literature on AI in maxillofacial prosthodontics, focusing on its role in craniofacial rehabilitation.
Methods
This scoping review adhered to the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis (2020). Reporting complied with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to ensure clarity and reproducibility. The review was registered with the Open Science Framework (registration number: www.osf.io/3b9jr). Electronic databases, including Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar, were searched up to 7 June 2025. Full-text English articles containing the keywords “Artificial Intelligence and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics” and related terms were included.
Results
This scoping review included 35 articles from diverse geographic regions. The studies addressed several specific applications of AI in maxillofacial prosthodontics, including the production of implant-supported auricular prostheses, coloration of maxillofacial prostheses, evaluation of facial attractiveness in patients with clefts, capture of 3D impressions of cleft palates, identification of hypernasality, assessment of lip symmetry, and detection of teeth in cleft lip and palate cases.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence offers significant opportunities for maxillofacial prosthodontics, especially in imaging, digital design, and prosthesis production. Progress in this area requires interdisciplinary teamwork, large-scale clinical trials, and the development of standardized validation methods to ensure safe and effective clinical application.}

The high mortality rate is concerning, and tumour heterogeneity at the genetic, phenotypic, and pathological levels exacerbates the problem. In this context, lack of early diagnostic techniques and therapeutic resistance to drugs, sole awareness among the public, coupled with the unavailability of these modern technologies in developing and low-income countries, negatively impact cancer management. One of the prime necessities of the world today is the enhancement of early detection of cancers. Several independent studies have shown that screening individuals for cancer can improve patient survival but are bogged down by risk classification and major problems in patient selection. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the field of oncology, addressing various medical challenges, particularly in cancer management. Leveraging extensive medical datasets and innovative computational technologies, AI, especially through deep learning (DL), has found applications across multiple facets of oncology research. These applications range from early cancer detection, diagnosis, classification, and grading, molecular characterization of tumours, prediction of patient outcomes and treatment responses, personalized treatment, and novel anti-cancer drug discovery. Over the past decade, AI/ML has emerged as a valuable tool in cancer prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment selection for cancer patients. Several patents have been and are being filed and granted. Some of those inventions were explored and are being explored in clinical settings as well. In this review, we will discuss the current status, recent advancements, clinical trials, challenges, and opportunities associated with AI/ML applications in cancer detection and management.

Traditional supervised deep learning models rely heavily on extensive labeled data, which is resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially in the medical field. To overcome this challenge, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning systems, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, have been widely explored. Consequently, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) systems, which leverage both labelled and unlabeled data to improve diagnostic performance and efficiency, have been widely studied. This review explores the use of Semi-SL and Self-SL in managing large volumes of unlabeled data alongside labelled data as feasible options for medical image analysis, especially for MRI, X-ray, and CT scans. The study highlights key SSL techniques such as contrastive learning, reconstruction-based training, and pseudo-labelling for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and model generalization. Specifically, contrastive learning has demonstrated benefits in X-ray anomaly detection, pseudo-labelling has improved fracture identification and brain region segmentation, and reconstruction-based training has advanced MRI and generative 3D CT scan image reconstruction models. Although these approaches still face challenges such as data availability, computational requirements, and model interpretability, they exhibit great potential for clinical use. This research further examines the capacity of Semi-SL and Self-SL to increase diagnostic precision, deliver clinically feasible timeframes, and provide cost-effective care. Future work will aim to refine these methods for better clinical integration and to make them more understandable to clinicians.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetic foot disease (DFD) is serious complication of diabetes with a multifactorial etiology and carries a significant risk of lower limb amputations. The prevalence of DFD continues to grow globally. Artificial intelligence has been proposed in aiding early detection and risk stratification for ulceration and other major complications, including sepsis, minor or major lower limb amputation, and death. We systematically reviewed the literature available on the use of artificial intelligence in three-dimensional imaging modalities in DFD.
Methods
A literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Embase and Medline (via the Ovid interface), CINAHL (via Ebsco Host), Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched. The gray literature was also reviewed on ClinicalTrials.gov and the National Institute for Health Research journals library. The medical subject headings terms “diabetes” AND “diabetic foot disease” AND “artificial intelligence” and various permutations of three-dimensional imaging modalities, including “computed tomography,” “magnetic resonance imaging” and “positron emission tomography” were used in the primary search string. The articles were independently screened and reviewed by two reviewers.
Results
We identified 4865 studies and removed 102 duplicates. We excluded 4721 during title and abstract screening. Overall, 42 articles underwent full text review and 1 article was included in the final review, which used computed tomography scanning in patients with DFD to create a risk prediction model.
Conclusions
The use of machine learning and deep learning models is still being explored and evaluated in this context. Current methodologies focus on wound imaging classification, plantar thermography and plantar pressures. Specialized models that evaluate three-dimensional imaging are currently primitive and limited in their use; however, they have potential for the generation of suprahuman insights into existing imaging, extraction of novel metadata features, and prediction using integration of multidimensional patient characteristics.}

abstract = {Background
Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis (AVN), is a complicated condition that can develop after total hip arthroplasty, trauma, chronic corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, and in association with medical conditions like sickle cell anemia and lupus. AVN can potentially lead to osteoarthritis and poor postoperative outcomes (e.g., sepsis and readmission), highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. Deep learning approaches have been deployed in various medical fields to improve and facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, and classification. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) models in detecting and classifying hip AVN, by synthesizing pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates and exploring key sources of heterogeneity.
Methods
A comprehensive systematic search was executed across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane library. Studies were included if they measured osteonecrosis on X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), and MRI using deep learning models.
Results
A total of 21 publications were included, containing 19,168 hips with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH); 47,389 healthy hips; and 6784 hips with other conditions; 319 AVN lunate with 1228 controls. Across nine studies with sufficient data, the pooled sensitivity and specificity averaged 90 % (95 % CI: 80–95) and 98 % (95 % CI: 95–99), respectively. Among these, CNN-based models demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with several studies reporting sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90 %. However, substantial heterogeneity was detected, with I2 values of 89.82 % for sensitivity and 81.44 % for specificity (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Although our meta-analysis did not reveal significant difference in sensitivity and specificity, it has been observed that convolutional neural networks(CNNs) outperformed conventional techniques in the detection and classification of ONFH. With high accuracy and specificity, they have shown promising potential to reduce misdiagnosis and facilitate early detection of this condition.}

This paper presents a systematic literature mapping following a structured protocol across multiple academic databases. A total of 244 studies published between 2016 and 2025 were analyzed from 171 distinct sources. Most studies employed AutoML for diagnosis prediction (52.8%) and prognosis prediction (31.9%), primarily using tabular (43.4%) and image (31.5%) data.

Although Explainable AI (XAI) was incorporated in only 30.7% of the studies, its adoption showed a notable increase in 2024. These findings indicate that while the application of AutoML in medicine is growing, its black-box nature continues to limit its adoption in interpretability-critical domains.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are revolutionizing brain cancer theranostics by enhancing drug delivery and diagnostic accuracy. This review examines AI-enhanced engineering strategies for developing intelligent nanocarriers that target glioblastoma and other metastatic central nervous system malignancies. AI encompasses several computational methods, including machine learning (ML) and its subset deep learning (DL). Here, ML algorithms learn design rules for nanocarriers, and DL networks intricate pattern recognition for tumor segmentation and adaptive release. These approaches enable stimuli-responsive nanocarriers to react to tumor microenvironmental signals (eg, pH, enzyme activity) and external stimuli (eg, ultrasound), optimizing targeted medication release while minimizing off-target effects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), in conjunction with AI, enhance tumor detection and segmentation, while the integration of multiomics data facilitates tailored treatment planning. Advanced technologies encompass transferrin-functionalized nanoparticles for traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and dual-stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems. Notwithstanding general progress, apprehensions surrounding batch variability and industrial scalability persist. This review also addresses ethical concerns and cost disparities associated with AI-based therapeutics. The primary development target areas are federated learning for data privacy, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for regulatory transparency, and quantum ML for molecular-scale optimization. This paper charts the course to patient-specific, scalable neuro-oncology nanomedicine through the convergence of computational modeling, intelligent materials, and advanced imaging modalities. These themes are explored in greater detail in the introduction, where we lay the groundwork for intelligent nanocarriers, their design with the help of AI, and the clinical need for diagnostics-therapeutics convergence in brain cancer.}

abstract = {Introduction
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer particularly in individuals aged 0–19, classified into different stages. Early diagnosis improves survival, Determination of prognosis and treatment based on it, and enables limb-sparing surgery. AI, in particular machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), helps analyze large datasets, identify biomarkers, predict prognosis, and personalize treatments by assessing the aforementioned features. AI has the potential to improve evaluation procedures, such as imaging and pathology approaches used in OS diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This study systematically examines AI's synergistic role with conventional evaluating techniques in OS treatment, improving prognostication, predicting therapy responses, and developing personalized treatment strategies.
Method
We performed an extensive search via several databases until April 23, 2024. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) as the main branches of AI are often utilized in the medical sciences were searched for detection classification, and prognostication of osteosarcoma. RAYYAN.ai was used to screen the articles through the titles and abstracts. We conducted data extraction on the included articles and employed Cochrane and QUIPS tools to assess potential bias in the included non-prognosis and prognosis studies to evaluate their quality, respectively.
Results
There were 8129 articles obtained from the four databases following a thorough search. Of them 8050 ones were excluded and the remaining 78 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were reviewed. A large number of the articles indicated moderate and low risk of bias as a result of the risk of bias assessment. The majority of the articles that were reviewed (n = 48) concerned the clinical aspects of osteosarcoma; of these, 23 and 25 studies assessed diagnosis and prognoses, respectively. Furthermore, 20 articles examined image analysis specifically, 4 examined image segmentation methods, and 16 introduced classifiers to identify osteosarcoma from other diseases.
Conclusion
AI improves biomarker identification, diagnostics, and prognosis of osteosarcoma through medical imaging and data integration. Models like ResNet50 and CNN show high performance but face real-world limitations due to data heterogeneity and overfitting. This study explores AI's role in osteosarcoma diagnosis, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, external validation, and real-world application challenges.}

The situation requires restarting the training process using both the old and the new data, which is computationally costly, does not align with the human learning process, and imposes storage constraints and privacy concerns. Alternatively, continual learning has emerged as a crucial approach for developing unified and sustainable deep models to deal with new classes, tasks, and the drifting nature of data in non-stationary environments for various application areas. Continual learning techniques enable models to adapt and accumulate knowledge over time, which is essential for maintaining performance on evolving datasets and novel tasks. Owing to its popularity and promising performance, it is an active and emerging research topic in the medical field and hence demands a survey and taxonomy to clarify the current research landscape of continual learning in medical image analysis. This systematic review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in continual learning techniques applied to medical image analysis. We present an extensive survey of existing research, covering topics including catastrophic forgetting, data drifts, stability, and plasticity requirements. Further, an in-depth discussion of key components of a continual learning framework, such as continual learning scenarios, techniques, evaluation schemes, and metrics, is provided. Continual learning techniques encompass various categories, including rehearsal, regularization, architectural, and hybrid strategies. We assess the popularity and applicability of continual learning categories in various medical sub-fields like radiology and histopathology.

abstract = {Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major health problem around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where it kills about 1.5 million people every year. Early and accurate identification is very important for treating the disease and stopping it from spreading. Traditional ways of diagnosing, like sputum smear microscopy, chest X-rays, and evaluating clinical symptoms, have problems like being less sensitive, taking longer to get results, and requiring biased interpretation. New developments in artificial intelligence (AI) point to hopeful directions, but most current models only use one type of data, which makes it harder for them to understand the disease's complicated symptoms.
Methods
This study suggests a new multi-modal AI system that combines data on symptoms, chest X-ray images, and clinical factors to help find TB earlier. Structured symptom surveys, digital chest X-rays, and electronic health record clinical data were some of the healthcare sources from which patient data were gathered. For example, natural language processing was used for symptoms and convolutional neural networks were used for images.
Results
The multi-modal model achieved 92.4 % accuracy, 91.1 % sensitivity, 93.2 % specificity, and AUC 0.95, outperforming uni-modal models. Integrating imaging, clinical, and symptom data improved diagnostic reliability and reduced false positives.
Conclusion
Imaging, clinical, and symptom data integrated by multi-modal AI improves early TB diagnostic accuracy and reliability. This technology allows early management and may reduce global TB-related illnesses and fatalities by providing scalable and adaptable testing assistance for a wide range of clinical scenarios. Additional datasets and real-time clinical contact will be the subject of future research.}

This is important because children differ significantly from adults in terms of physiology, developmental stages, and clinical needs, necessitating tailored approaches for the safe and effective integration of AI tools. This multisociety position statement systematically addresses four critical pillars of AI adoption: (1) regulation and purchasing, (2) implementation and integration, (3) interpretation and postmarket surveillance, and (4) education. We propose pediatric-specific safety ratings, inclusion of datasets from diverse pediatric populations, quantifiable transparency metrics, and explainability of models to mitigate biases and ensure AI systems are appropriate for use in children. Risk assessment, dataset diversity, transparency, and cybersecurity are important steps in regulation and purchasing. For successful implementation, a phased strategy is recommended, involving early pilot testing, stakeholder engagement, and comprehensive postmarket surveillance with continuous monitoring of defined performance benchmarks. Clear protocols for managing discrepancies and adverse incident reporting are essential to maintain trust and safety. Moreover, we emphasize the need for foundational AI literacy courses for all health care professionals that include pediatric safety considerations, alongside specialized training for those directly involved in pediatric imaging. Public and patient engagement is crucial to foster understanding and acceptance of AI in pediatric radiology. Ultimately, we advocate for a child-centered framework for AI integration, ensuring that the distinct needs of children are prioritized and that their safety, accuracy, and overall well-being are safeguarded.}

This systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct for articles published from 2020 onwards, using keywords related to “Focal Cortical Dysplasia,” “MRI,” and “Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Deep Learning.” Included were original studies employing AI and structural MRI (sMRI) for FCD detection in humans, reporting quantitative performance metrics, and published in English. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third.
Results
The included studies demonstrated that AI significantly improved FCD detection, achieving sensitivity up to 97.1 % and specificities up to 84.3 % across various MRI sequences, including MPRAGE, MP2RAGE, and FLAIR. AI models, particularly deep learning models, matched or surpassed human radiologist performance, with combined AI-human expertise reaching up to 87 % detection rates. Among 88 full-text articles reviewed, 27 met inclusion criteria.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled tools are shifting from theoretical or research-only applications to mature, clinically useful tools. The goal of this article was to provide a scoping review of the most mature AI/ML-enabled technologies reviewed and cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration relevant to the field of vascular surgery. Despite decades of slow progress, this landscape is now evolving rapidly, with more than 100 AI/ML-powered tools being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration each year. Within the field of vascular surgery specifically, this review identified 17 companies with mature technologies that have at least one US Food and Drug Administration clearance, all occurring between 2016 and 2022. The maturation of these technologies appears to be accelerating, with improving regulatory clarity and clinical uptake. The early AI/ML-powered devices extend or amplify clinically entrenched platform technologies and tend to be focused on the diagnosis or evaluation of time-sensitive, clinically important pathologies (eg, reading Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine–compliant computed tomography images to identify pulmonary embolism), or when physician efficiency or time savings is improved (eg, preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance). The majority (>75%) of these technologies are at the intersection of radiology and vascular surgery. It is becoming increasingly important that the contemporary vascular surgeon understands this shifting paradigm, as these once-nascent technologies are finally maturing and will be encountered with increasingly regularity in daily clinical practice.}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, have enabled the integration of diverse clinical data modalities to support diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognostication in bone oncology. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of AI-driven multimodal fusion strategies that incorporate radiological imaging, digital pathology, multi-omics profiling, and electronic health records. We conducted a structured review of peer-reviewed literature published between 2015 and early 2025, focusing on the development, validation, and clinical applicability of AI models for BT diagnosis, subtyping, treatment response prediction, and recurrence monitoring. Although multimodal models have demonstrated advantages over unimodal approaches, especially in handling missing data and improving generalizability, most remain constrained by single-center study designs, small sample sizes, and limited prospective or external validation. Persistent technical and translational challenges include semantic misalignment across modalities, incomplete datasets, limited model interpretability, and regulatory and infrastructural barriers to clinical integration. To address these limitations, we highlight emerging directions such as contrastive representation learning, generative data augmentation, transformer-based fusion architectures, and privacy-preserving federated learning. We also discuss the evolving role of foundation models and workflow-integrated AI agents in enhancing scalability and clinical usability. In summary, multimodal AI represents a promising paradigm for advancing precision care in BTs. Realizing its full clinical potential will require methodologically rigorous, biologically informed, and system-level approaches that bridge algorithmic innovation with real-world healthcare delivery.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now transforming medical imaging, with extensive ramifications for nearly every aspect of diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT). This current work aims to review, evaluate, and summarise the role of AI in radiation dose optimisation across three fundamental domains in CT: patient positioning, scan range determination, and image reconstruction.
Methods
A comprehensive scoping review of the literature was performed. Electronic databases including Scopus, Ovid, EBSCOhost and PubMed were searched between January 2018 and December 2024. Relevant articles were identified from their titles had their abstracts evaluated, and those deemed relevant had their full text reviewed. Extracted data from selected studies included the application of AI, radiation dose, anatomical part, and any relevant evaluation metrics based on the CT parameter in which AI is applied.
Results
90 articles met the selection criteria. Included studies evaluated the performance of AI for dose optimisation through patient positioning, scan range determination, and reconstruction across various CT scans, including the abdomen, chest, head, neck, and pelvis, as well as CT angiography. A concise overview of the present state of AI in these three domains, emphasising benefits, limitations, and impact on the transformation of dose reduction in CT scanning, is provided.
Conclusions
AI methods can help minimise positioning offsets and over-scanning caused by manual errors and helped to overcome the limitation associated with low-dose CT settings through deep learning image reconstruction algorithms. Further clinical integration of AI will continue to allow for improvements in optimising CT scan protocols and radiation dose.
Implications for practice
This review underscores the significance of AI in optimizing radiation doses in CT imaging, focusing on three key areas: patient positioning, scan range determination, and image reconstruction.}

The use of AI in diagnostics, image processing and interpretation, treatment personalization, clinical documentation, and drug discovery is an example of the implementation of AI in Western medicine. The need for evidence-based studies and a standardized approach to scientific medicine aligns well with these applications. AI can leave a lasting impact on the Chinese medicine (CM) landscape by increasing expectations and presenting new challenges. The analogy between the CM-specific diagnostic methods and syndrome differentiation, which is holistic, pattern-oriented, patient-centered, and clinical data analysis, is significant at multiple levels. These qualities pose challenges for AI usage in CM, which heavily relies on structured data and pattern recognition. Despite these adversities, AI can still be used in CM through data standardization, prediction formulation, and treatment planning, provided that the integration of this tool considers the primary principles of CM and adheres to ethical and regulatory considerations. This review examines the dichotomous approach to health and medicine in the contexts of AI and CM, highlighting the evolving potential, inherent limitations, and ethical and regulatory issues associated with the application of AI to CM. It provides a foundation for developing technologically progressive yet culturally and philosophically sensitive strategies that are in harmony with traditional clinical values.}

The complexity and heterogeneity of cancer makes early detection and effective treatment crucial to enhance patient survival and quality of life. The intrinsic creative ability of artificial intelligence (AI) offers improvements in patient screening, diagnosis, and individualized care. Advanced technologies, like computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, can analyze large datasets and identify patterns that permit early cancer detection, diagnosis, management and incorporation of conclusive treatment plans, ensuring improved quality of life for patients by personalizing care and minimizing unnecessary interventions. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data can be combined with AI algorithms to unveil an extensive overview of cancer biology, assisting in its detailed understanding and will help in identifying new drug targets and developing effective therapies. This can also help to identify personalized molecular signatures which can facilitate tailored interventions addressing the unique aspects of each patient. AI-driven transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomes represents a revolutionary strategy to improve patient outcome by offering precise diagnosis and tailored therapy. The inclusion of AI in oncology may boost efficiency, reduce errors, and save costs, but it cannot take the role of medical professionals.

abstract = {One of the most interesting applications of artificial intelligence is in the design of drug delivery systems. Smart drug delivery systems can transfer drugs to specific tissues and cells, enhancing therapeutic effects while reducing undesirable side effects. Attention is focused on the main concepts and techniques of AI such as machine learning, deep learning, and genetic algorithms. In addition to this, genetic algorithms can be used for the selection of the best numerical models, which are able to predict biological processes or optimize the activity of new drugs. Besides the powerful impact of AI on drug design, its combination with new biotechnologies for personalized medicine, sometimes called theragnostics, brings novel diagnostic tools together with targeted therapy, which could ensure quality and effectiveness during clinical research on new drugs. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are finding their application in almost all disciplines, with particular success in healthcare. AI-based algorithms can solve complex problems related to diagnosis, prediction, control, and prevention of diseases that are beyond the scope of human abilities. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has added value to the healthcare sector. The resulting combination of IoT and AI platforms presents a promising fusion to provide healthcare delivery innovations like digital drug delivery, online healthcare consultancy platforms, and virtual healthcare assistants. Personalized medicine is well-suited, regardless of potential disadvantages, to creating drug delivery systems that can respond to the exact needs and other special requirements of patients. The development of smart drug delivery systems is a potential response to the unimodal properties of drugs and the discordance between patient requirements and patient outcomes achieved by currently prescribed medications. The potential and actual positive economic and health-related impacts of advanced drug delivery technologies have created strong demand for new advanced delivery forms.}

In dentistry, developers have created AI-based systems to assist in diagnosing and treating dental problems. In medicine, experts classify AI into two subtypes: virtual and physical. The virtual subtype includes neural network-based guidance in treatment decisions and electronic health records, while the physical subtype includes robots assisting in surgeries, intelligent prostheses, and elderly care. In dentistry, AI technology is applied in areas such as electronic record keeping, radiographic imaging, caries detection, diagnostic image analysis, and pathology. The history of AI research dates back to ancient times, with significant contributors such as Aristotle, Ramon Llull, Gottfried Leibniz, and George Boole. AI has two main streams: strong AI and weak AI, with the former seeking to create machines that can think and learn like humans and the latter aiming to build specialized systems that can perform specific tasks. In dentistry, professionals have leveraged AI to enhance data processing, extract information, and create applications that fall into four key areas: Diagnosis, decision-making, treatment planning, and predicting treatment outcomes. Among these, Diagnosis is the most popular Application of AI in dentistry, as it provides more accurate and effective diagnoses, thereby reducing the workload of dentists. Image-based tasks are particularly suitable for AI applications, especially in diagnosing dental problems.

abstract = {Objectives
To broadly map the research landscape to identify trends, gaps, and opportunities in data sets, methodologies, outcomes, and reporting standards for artificial intelligence (AI)-based healthcare utilization prediction.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. We searched 3 major international databases (from inception to January 2025) for studies applying AI in predictive healthcare utilization. Extracted data were categorized into data sets characteristics, AI methods and performance metrics, predicted outcomes, and adherence to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) + AI reporting guidelines.
Results
Among 1116 records, 121 met inclusion criteria. Most were conducted in the United States (62%). No study incorporated all 6 relevant variable groups: demographic, socioeconomic, health status, perceived need, provider characteristics, and prior utilization. Only 7 studies included 5 of these groups. The main data sources were electronic health records (60%) and claims (28%). Ensemble models were the most frequently used (66.9%), whereas deep learning models were less common (16.5%). AI methods were primarily used to predict future events (90.1%), with hospitalizations (57.9%) and visits (33.1%) being the most predicted outcomes. Adherence to general reporting standards was moderate; however, compliance with AI-specific TRIPOD + AI items was limited.
Conclusions
Future research should broaden predicted outcomes to include process- and logistics-oriented events, extend applications beyond prediction—such as cohort selection and matching—and explore underused AI methods, including distance-based algorithms and deep neural networks. Strengthening adherence to TRIPOD-AI reporting guidelines is also essential to enhance the reliability and impact of AI in healthcare planning and economic evaluation.}

The employment of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cancer management is well documented. The diversity and complexity of models, approaches, endpoints and anatomies makes it difficult to draw pertinent conclusions regarding the usefulness of ML in various applications. Given that clinical trials, particularly randomized ones, are the gold standard when testing new techniques, the current work aims to collate trials that investigated the effectiveness of ML in head and neck cancer (HNC).
Methods
A systematic search of Medline/PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed to identify clinical trials reporting the use of AI / ML in HNC for either of the following clinical aspects: detection / classification, image segmentation and treatment response / dose distribution prediction. Of the 2395 identified studies, 42 met the eligibility criteria.
Results
Most studies confirmed the usefulness of ML in HNC clinical applications through reported parameters: accuracy, area under the curve, specificity, sensitivity, dice coefficient. Deep learning models utilizing multiple layered neural networks were often the choice as they outperform machine learning in predictive model development. However, traditional algorithms (KNN, SVM, logistic regression) often showed comparable results with deep learning. The most commonly used radiomic features were related to image texture irrespective of the model’s application.
Conclusions
Clinical trial results show a supportive role for ML in HNC management, whether diagnostic/staging- or treatment-related. The best performing applications are enhancing deep learning algorithms applied to imaging with clinical data for a more comprehensive and better-integrated approach to personalized treatment.}

abstract = {As one of the leading causes of death worldwide, early detection of lung disease is a very important step to improve the effectiveness of treatment. By using medical image data, such as X-ray or CT-scan, classification of lung disease can be done. Deep learning methods have been widely used to recognize complex patterns in medical images, but this approach has the constraints of requiring large data variations and high computing resources. In overcoming these constraints, the lightweight architecture in deep learning can provide a more efficient solution based on the number of parameters and computing time. This method can be applied to devices with low processor specifications on portable devices such as mobile phones. This article presents a comprehensive review of 23 research studies published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on various lightweight architectures and optimization techniques aimed at improving the accuracy of lung disease detection. The results show that these models are able to significantly reduce parameter sizes, resulting in faster computation times while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to traditional deep learning architectures. From the research that has been done, it can be seen that SqueezeNet applied on public COVID-19 datasets is the best basic architecture with high accuracy, and the number of parameters is 570 thousand, which is very low. On the other hand, UNet requires 31.07 million parameters, and SegNet requires 29.45 million parameters trained on CT scan images from Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology and Radiopedia, so it is less efficient. For the combination method, EfficientNetV2 and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are able to achieve the highest accuracy of 98.20 % and can significantly reduce parameters. The worst performance is shown by VGG and UNet with a decrease in accuracy from 91.05 % to 87 % and an increase in the number of parameters. It can be concluded that the lightweight architecture can be applied to medical image classification in the diagnosis of lung disease quickly and efficiently on devices with limited specifications.}

However, the literature shows contradictory results regarding the usefulness of eye-tracking data in deep-learning architectures for abnormality detection. We argue that these discrepancies between studies in the literature are due to (a) the way eye-tracking data is (or is not) processed, (b) the types of deep learning architectures chosen, and (c) the type of application that these architectures will have. We conducted a systematic literature review using PRISMA to address these contradicting results. We analyzed 60 studies that incorporated eye-tracking data in a deep-learning approach for different application goals in radiology. We performed a comparative analysis to understand if eye gaze data contains feature maps that can be useful under a deep learning approach and whether they can promote more interpretable predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey in the area that performs a thorough investigation of eye gaze data processing techniques and their impacts in different deep learning architectures for applications such as error detection, classification, object detection, expertise level analysis, fatigue estimation and human attention prediction in medical imaging data. Our analysis resulted in two main contributions: (1) taxonomy that first divides the literature by task, enabling us to analyze the value eye movement can bring for each case and build guidelines regarding architectures and gaze processing techniques adequate for each application, and (2) an overall analysis of how eye gaze data can promote explainability in radiology.}

La plupart des programmes ont adopté un mode d'enseignement en ligne, et la durée des programmes a varié de manière significative. Tous les programmes ont utilisé des présentations didactiques, et plusieurs d'entre eux ont incorporé des méthodes d'enseignement et des activités supplémentaires pour atteindre les objectifs du programme d'études. Les publics cibles et les participants étaient principalement des résidents en radiologie, tandis que les créateurs et les instructeurs formaient une équipe multidisciplinaire de radiologues et d'informaticiens. Différents outils et ressources ont été utilisés, notamment des cours en ligne et des carnets de notes en infonuagique. Les programmes ont été bien accueillis par les participants, et les contraintes de temps sont apparues comme un défi majeur.
Conclusion
Cet examen exploratoire fournit une vue d'ensemble des programmes de formation à l'IA à partir de la littérature existante afin d'orienter les développements futurs des programmes de formation à l'IA. Les efforts futurs en matière de formation devraient donner la priorité à la conception de programmes fondés sur des données probantes, élargir l'offre de formation aux radiographes, augmenter l'offre de contenu en informatique de l'imagerie et utiliser efficacement différentes stratégies d'enseignement et différents outils et ressources de formation dans le programme d'études.}

abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into hip and knee surgery has been evolving rapidly, with significant implications for diagnostics, surgical planning, and outcome prediction. However, there has been limited literature with comprehensive overview of AI in arthroplasty surgery. This bibliometric analysis aims to identify the 50 most cited articles on AI in hip and knee surgery, highlighting key contributors, research trends, and methodological patterns.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that AI has generated a growing body of influential research in hip and knee surgery, with specific trends in applications, geographic distribution, and methodological approaches.
Material and methods
A systematic search was performed in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on July 14, 2025, using predefined keywords related to AI and hip/knee surgery. Original research articles were screened and ranked by citation count. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze bibliometric variables including authorship, journal impact factor, country of origin, and AI techniques.
Results
The 50 most cited articles, published between 2016 and 2023, accumulated a total of 7,140 citations (mean: 142.8; range: 59–735). The most cited article received 735 citations. The United States was the most prolific contributor, accounting for 27 articles (54.0%) and 2,772 citations (38.8%). Deep learning was the most frequently used AI technique (29 articles, 58% of articles). Knee-related topics were predominant, addressed in 32 articles (64.0%) while hip-related studies represented 18 articles (36.0%). Thematic focus was predominantly diagnostic with 31 articles (62.0%) centered on radiographic interpretation. There was no significant correlation between journal impact factor and citation count (Pearson’s r = 0.21; p = 0.28).
Discussion
This bibliometric analysis outlines the foundational literature driving AI adoption in hip and knee surgery. While the field is rapidly expanding, research remains unevenly distributed, with limited focus on hip surgery and treatment-oriented AI. Future studies should emphasize clinical validation, generalizability, and the integration of explainable AI into orthopedic practice.

Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology that promises to assist clinicians in improving patient care. In radiology, deep learning (DL) is widely used in clinical decision aids due to its ability to analyze complex patterns and images. It allows for rapid, enhanced data, and imaging analysis, from diagnosis to outcome prediction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current literature and clinical utilization of DL in spine imaging.
Methods
This study is a scoping review and utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to review the scientific literature from 2012 to 2021. A search in PubMed, Web of Science, Embased, and IEEE Xplore databases with syntax specific for DL and medical imaging in spine care applications was conducted to collect all original publications on the subject. Specific data was extracted from the available literature, including algorithm application, algorithms tested, database type and size, algorithm training method, and outcome of interest.
Results
A total of 365 studies (total sample of 232,394 patients) were included and grouped into 4 general applications: diagnostic tools, clinical decision support tools, automated clinical/instrumentation assessment, and clinical outcome prediction. Notable disparities exist in the selected algorithms and the training across multiple disparate databases. The most frequently used algorithms were U-Net and ResNet. A DL model was developed and validated in 92% of included studies, while a pre-existing DL model was investigated in 8%. Of all developed models, only 15% of them have been externally validated.
Conclusions
Based on this scoping review, DL in spine imaging is used in a broad range of clinical applications, particularly for diagnosing spinal conditions. There is a wide variety of DL algorithms, database characteristics, and training methods. Future studies should focus on external validation of existing models before bringing them into clinical use.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Access to diagnostic imaging in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited by scarce equipment, geographic barriers, weak digital infrastructure, and shortages of trained personnel. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to mitigate these gaps by improving diagnostic accuracy, assisting non-specialist health workers, and optimizing workflows. This scoping review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the use of AI for interpreting radiological diagnostic images in LMICs.
Materials and Methods
A scoping review was conducted in July 2025 following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Clinical Key for studies published between 2000 and July 2025 in English and Spanish. Eligible studies included clinical applications of AI in radiological imaging within LMICs, reporting relevant outcomes.
Results
From 620 records, 51 studies conducted across 33 LMICs were included. Most were published between 2022 and 2025 and focused on ultrasound, X-ray, and computed tomography. AI consistently improved diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and applicability, particularly for tuberculosis, pneumonia, obstetric care, and oncologic screening. Magnetic resonance imaging showed promising yet mostly experimental evidence, while mammography research remained scarce. Frequent limitations included small sample sizes, single-center designs, reliance on public datasets, and limited multicenter validation.
Conclusion
AI demonstrates significant potential to enhance the interpretation of diagnostic radiological images in LMICs, with consistent gains in sensitivity, specificity, and applicability across modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray, and computed tomography. Several studies also reported improvements in workflow efficiency and support for non-specialist providers, underscoring AI’s dual role as a diagnostic and operational tool. Nonetheless, methodological heterogeneity and infrastructural challenges highlight the need for multicenter validation and context-adapted implementation strategies to ensure sustainable integration.}

abstract = {Fetal neurodevelopment is a complex process of neural growth during pregnancy, where early detection of abnormalities is vital, and deep learning offers promising techniques for this purpose. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate deep learning applications in fetal neurodevelopment, aiming to synthesize cutting-edge research, examine methodologies, identify research gaps, and propose a federated learning framework. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, 55 peer-reviewed articles were selected from an initial 900 records across major databases and additional sources where each article was examined through six specific data extraction criteria. Peer-reviewed articles from 2005 to 2025, specifically those exploring automated deep learning for fetal neurodevelopment using clinical images were included, while non-deep learning analyses were excluded. Risk of bias was qualitatively assessed based on design, data diversity, validation, and reporting. Key scopes of the studies included brain segmentation and regionalization (50.91%), structural measurement (12.73%), image reconstruction, enhancement and synthesis (21.82%) and predictive modeling and clinical classification (14.55%) which also distinguishes between tasks involving pixel-level analysis and image-level predictions. The 55 included studies used diverse datasets (753 to 433,000 images) as well as synthetic image data in some recent works covering wide-ranging gestational ages, mainly using MRI and ultrasound images. The systematic analysis explicitly categorizes each study by task type, applied methodology (U-Net variants, transformer-based models, CNNs, implicit neural representations), and corresponding evaluation metrics—segmentation (DSC, IoU, HD95), classification (Accuracy, Precision, AUC), regression (MAE, RMSE, R2), and reconstruction (PSNR, SSIM), facilitating standardized performance comparisons and establishing clear benchmarks for future research in automated fetal brain imaging. Significant gaps that were identified include inadequate data diversity, privacy measures, limited clinical interpretability and validity of AI models, and insufficient integration of multimodal data. To address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed that integrates multimodal data fusion, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) paradigms, and federated learning architectures complemented by synthetic data generation techniques to ensure robust privacy preservation in real-world application.

abstract = {Summary
Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving treatment for individuals with end-stage liver disease. The management of LT recipients is complex, predominantly because of the need to consider demographic, clinical, laboratory, pathology, imaging, and omics data in the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Current methods to collate clinical information are susceptible to some degree of subjectivity; thus, clinical decision-making in LT could benefit from the data-driven approach offered by artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning and deep learning could be applied in both the pre- and post-LT settings. Some examples of AI applications pre-transplant include optimising transplant candidacy decision-making and donor-recipient matching to reduce waitlist mortality and improve post-transplant outcomes. In the post-LT setting, AI could help guide the management of LT recipients, particularly by predicting patient and graft survival, along with identifying risk factors for disease recurrence and other associated complications. Although AI shows promise in medicine, there are limitations to its clinical deployment which include dataset imbalances for model training, data privacy issues, and a lack of available research practices to benchmark model performance in the real world. Overall, AI tools have the potential to enhance personalised clinical decision-making, especially in the context of liver transplant medicine.}

Multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTs) coordinate complex oncology decisions across imaging, pathology, genomics, and patient factors. Here we synthesize how artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and large language models—supports MDT preparation and deliberation. Across cancers, reported agreement between AI recommendations and MDT decisions commonly ranges from 70% to 90%, and task-focused tools achieve high diagnostic performance in screening and staging. Benefits include faster information synthesis, more consistent guideline alignment, and clearer documentation of options, while human review remains central. Key limitations—data bias, uneven generalizability, privacy and governance concerns, and limited prospective validation—temper adoption. We outline implementation priorities: prospective multicenter evaluation, integration with electronic records, clinician training, and transparent oversight. Overall, AI can augment MDT decision-making and help personalize care and workflow efficiency when deployed with rigorous evaluation and safeguards.}

abstract = {Objective
This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, with the aim of addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications.
Methodology
We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, we combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, in order to improve model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques.
Key findings
The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31 % accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as eXplanation with Gradient-weighted Class activation mapping (XgradCAM), effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, such as EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08).
Implications
Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.}

This scoping review investigates how AI is applied in dental care for individuals with chronic conditions that affect daily functioning and complicate dental management. The focus is on AI's role in early detection and diagnostic evaluation within the dental practices for medically compromised patients.
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and specific AI- and dental-related keywords. Articles were selected, charted, and analyzed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) scoping review framework.
Results
A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. AI methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, were utilised for diagnosing oral conditions, including periodontitis, osteoporosis, and oral cancer. While most studies reported encouraging diagnostic performance (sensitivity above 60 %, precision up to 99 %), several limitations were common, including a lack of external validation, small sample sizes, and heterogeneous reporting standards.
Conclusion
AI shows significant potential in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of oral diseases among medically compromised patients. Nevertheless, current evidence is limited by methodological weaknesses. Future research should focus on robust external validation, multicentre data collection, and standardised reporting of diagnostic performance to support clinical implementation.}

To organize the existing literature regarding applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biopsies and imaging modalities of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) and to familiarize readers with the most commonly occurring concepts.
Results
Firstly, we present a workflow that summarizes techniques implemented in AI for biopsies and imaging modalities in SARDs. Next, we describe challenges specific to image analysis for medicine. Subsequently, we describe the goals for an AI study in this field, and the prerequisites to meet them in SARDs. Finally, after reviewing the existing literature, we present the applications of AI for image analysis in each SARD. Accordingly, we analyze 1–2 studies from each SARD and mention key messages and lessons derived from them. Lastly, we create a recommendation landscape identifying unmet needs for AI applications in each SARD. The vast majority of studies employ supervised learning for image classification or segmentation, and rarely for regression. The median dataset size was 116 patients for imaging studies and 271 patients for biopsies studies, while the number of images per study varied greatly. Reporting of multiple performance metrics was frequently neglected.
Conclusions
Employing AI for SARD image analysis ultimately demands large datasets with multimodal and adequately diverse data to effectively capture the heterogeneity of SARDs. In the field of rheumatology, plagued by subjectivity and interobserver variability, issues regarding data quality, regulatory authorities and the specificity and clinical impact of questions posed will define the time needed for clinical adoption of AI-assisted medical care.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted examination for cancer detection in medical imaging.
Methods
We searched seven databases from January 1, 2017, until June 30, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were detection rates and patient-centered outcomes. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results
We included 49 RCTs covering seven cancer types, with 79.6% (n=39) being colorectal cancer. AI-assisted examination showed varying effects on detection rates across different cancer types. Specifically, regarding colorectal cancer, AI increased detection rates for both adenoma (pooled RR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.17-1.28, 36 RCTs) and polyp (pooled RR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.26, 28 RCTs). For esophageal cancer, positive effects were also observed on the detection rates of high-risk esophageal lesions (RR=2.01, 95% CI: 1.06-3.80, 1 RCT) as well as superficial oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and precancerous lesions (RR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.86, 1 RCT). Moreover, statistically significant improvement in detection rates were observed in prostate cancer (pooled RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.10-1.77, 1 RCT with 3 arms), actionable lung nodules (RR=2.38, 95% CI: 1.25-4.55, 1 RCT) for lung cancer, and breast cancer (RR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.45, 1 RCT). However, no significant effect was observed on the detection rates of gastric or liver cancer.
Conclusions
AI-assisted examinations may improve certain detection rates but not all among seven cancer types. There is a notable lack of patient-centered outcomes, crucial for evaluating the ultimate benefits to patients. Future research should give priority to assessing the impact of AI on patient-centered outcomes beyond diagnostic accuracy.}

abstract = {Background
With advancements in medical technology and science, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the world’s three major chronic diseases, has seen numerous remarkable outcomes when combined with artificial intelligence, particularly in disease diagnosis. However, the diagnostic performance of these AI models still lacks comprehensive evidence. Therefore, this study quantitatively analyzed the diagnostic performance of AI models in CT images of COPD patients, aiming to promote the development of related research in the future.
Methods
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase were retrieved up to September 1, 2024. The QUADAS-2 evaluation tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis of the included researches was performed using Stata18, RevMan 5.4, and Meta-Disc 1.4 software to merge sensitivity, specificity and plot a summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic, and sources of inter-study heterogeneity were explored through meta-regression analysis.
Results
Twenty-two of 3280 identified studies were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed on 15 of these studies, encompassing a total of 22,817 patients for which statistical metrics were reported or could be calculated. Seven studies were based on deep learning (DL) model, three on machine learning (ML) model, and five on DL model with multiple-instance learning (MIL) mechanisms. One study evaluated both DL and ML models. The meta-analysis results showed that the pooled sensitivity of all DL and ML models was 86 % (95 %CI 78–91 %), specificity was 87 % (95 %CI 83–91 %), and area under the curve was 93 % (95 %CI 90–95 %). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity between DL and ML models (sensitivity 82 % (95 %CI 76–87 %), 93 % (95 %CI 85–97 %); specificity 87 % (95 %CI 79–91 %), 84 % (95 %CI 79–88 %), and the DL model with MIL (sensitivity 87 % (95 %CI 61–96 %); specificity 89 % (95 %CI 78–95 %) improved the performance of DL model, but this improvement was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
Conclusion
Both DL and ML models for diagnosing COPD using CT images exhibited high accuracy. There was no significant difference in diagnostic efficacy between the two types of AI models, and the addition of the MIL mechanism may enhance the performance of the DL model.}

abstract = {Purpose
Artificial intelligence (AI) models are playing an increasing role in biomedical research and healthcare services. This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context.
Methods
A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections.
Results
We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way.
Conclusions
Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice.}

The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods in healthcare, particularly in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), has great potential to transform medical care. This umbrella systematic review explores the possibility of using machine and deep learning (ML and DL) in the management of critically ill patients.
Methods
The umbrella review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched in three databases from the beginning until March 1st, 2025. The articles that included machine or deep learning in the management of critically ill patients. The information about the author’s results, outcomes, goals, strengths, limitations, and ML or DL model types were extracted.
Results
After a careful search of electronic databases, 2148 records were found, of which 42 studies met the criteria for analysis. Key findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning techniques, to revolutionize clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in the ICU for sepsis, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological diseases. They manifested as early detection of complications, individualization of treatment approach and accurate prediction of clinical outcomes.
Conclusion
ML and DL models offer promising opportunities for treating patients in ICUs, but their clinical application remains limited due to insufficient external validation, methodological inconsistencies, and unresolved ethical issues. To narrow the gap between research and practice, future work should focus on developing clinically interpretable models, standardization of assessment protocols, and addressing ethical implications through proactive governance frameworks.}

The exponential growth of high-dimensional healthcare data, encompassing genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics profiles, as well as radiological imaging and histopathological slides, makes this approach increasingly important because, when examined separately, these data sources only offer a fragmented picture of intricate disease processes. Multimodal deep learning leverages the complementary properties of multiple data modalities to enable more accurate prognostic modeling, more robust disease characterization, and improved treatment decision-making. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of multimodal deep learning approaches in medical diagnosis. We classify and examine important application domains, such as (1) radiology, where automated report generation and lesion detection are facilitated by image-text integration; (2) histopathology, where fusion models improve tumor classification and grading; and (3) multi-omics, where molecular subtypes and latent biomarkers are revealed through cross-modal learning. We provide an overview of representative research, methodological advancements, and clinical consequences for each domain. Additionally, we critically analyzed the fundamental issues preventing wider adoption, including computational complexity (particularly in training scalable, multi-branch networks), data heterogeneity (resulting from modality-specific noise, resolution variations, and inconsistent annotations), and the challenge of maintaining significant cross-modal correlations during fusion. These problems impede interpretability, which is crucial for clinical trust and use, in addition to performance and generalizability. Lastly, we outline important areas for future research, including the development of standardized protocols for harmonizing data, the creation of lightweight and interpretable fusion architectures, the integration of real-time clinical decision support systems, and the promotion of cooperation for federated multimodal learning. Our goal is to provide researchers and clinicians with a concise overview of the field’s present state, enduring constraints, and exciting directions for further research through this review.}

As artificial intelligence (AI) gains prominence in pathology and medicine, the ethical implications and potential biases within such integrated AI models will require careful scrutiny. Ethics and bias are important considerations in our practice settings, especially as an increased number of machine learning (ML) systems are being integrated within our various medical domains. Such ML-based systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specified tasks such as, but not limited to, image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. However, the potential bias that may exist within such AI-ML models can also inadvertently lead to unfair and potentially detrimental outcomes. The source of bias within such ML models can be due to numerous factors but is typically categorized into 3 main buckets (data bias, development bias, and interaction bias). These could be due to the training data, algorithmic bias, feature engineering and selection issues, clinic and institutional bias (ie, practice variability), reporting bias, and temporal bias (ie, changes in technology, clinical practice, or disease patterns). Therefore, despite the potential of these AI-ML applications, their deployment in our day-to-day practice also raises noteworthy ethical concerns. To address ethics and bias in medicine, a comprehensive evaluation process is required, which will encompass all aspects of such systems, from model development through clinical deployment. Addressing these biases is crucial to ensure that AI-ML systems remain fair, transparent, and beneficial to all. This review will discuss the relevant ethical and bias considerations in AI-ML specifically within the pathology and medical domain.}

Pancreatic disease affects over 10% of the world population, and the most dangerous is pancreatic cancer (PC). The disease is mostly of late age of onset, especially in developed countries, and is associated with poor prognosis due to late presentation. Present screening tests like imaging and biomarkers are insensitive for the high-risk group. Invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities are other diagnostic tests with variable accuracy and accompanying risks. Chemotherapy and surgery are the first lines of treatment, but only 15%–20% of patients are eligible for surgery and the rate of recurrence is very high. Emerging technologies, including physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) and artificial intelligence (AI), are improving early detection techniques by evaluating images and synthesizing data more efficiently. Nanomedicine and AI-driven radiomics are individualizing diagnoses, enhancing drug delivery, and tackling tumor microenvironment issues. Hybrid model methodologies are improving prediction precision in oncology research, while computational drug development and liquid biopsy technologies enable early diagnosis and personalized treatment. The amalgamation of AI, imaging, nanomedicine, and physics-informed models has the potential to transform PC diagnostics, enhancing early detection and patient prognoses.}

abstract = {Background
Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used as an effective tool for liver imaging due to its high spatial resolution, and ability to differentiate tissue densities, which contributing to comprehensive image analysis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) promoted the role of Machine Learning (ML) in managing liver cancers by predicting or classifying tumours using mathematical algorithms. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, expanded these capabilities through convolutional neural networks (CNN) that analyse large data automatically. This review examines methods, achievements, limitations, and performance outcomes of ML-based radiomics and DL models for liver malignancies from CT imaging.
Method
A systematic search for full-text articles in English on CT radiomics and DL in liver cancer analysis was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Library databases between 2020 and 2024 using the keywords; machine learning, radiomics, deep learning, computed tomography, liver cancer and associated MESH terms. PRISMA guidelines were used to identify and screen studies for inclusion.
Results
A total of 49 studies were included consisting of 17 Radiomics, 24 DL, and 8 combined DL/Radiomics studies. Radiomics has been predominantly utilised for predictive analysis, while DL has been extensively applied to automatic liver and tumour segmentation with a surge of a recent increase in studies integrating both techniques.
Conclusion
Despite the growing popularity of DL methods, classical radiomics models are still relevant and often preferred over DL methods when performance is similar, due to lower computational and data needs. Performance of models keep improving, but challenges like data scarcity and lack of standardised protocols persists.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Medical imaging integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in predicting the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, the robustness of methodologies and predictive performance remains debated. This study systematically reviews and performs a meta-analysis to evaluate the advancements in AI-driven medical imaging for predicting the TIME in thoracic tumors, with a specific focus on Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). We hypothesize that medical imaging–based AI models can effectively predict key components of the tumor immune microenvironment in thoracic cancers, specifically PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published up to July 01, 2025. Studies evaluating AI-driven medical imaging for predicting thoracic tumor TIME were included. Diagnostic accuracy data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to assess the predictive performance of AI models for PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs. Heterogeneity analysis and publication bias assessment were also performed.
Results
A total of 68 studies were included, of which 25 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) for AI-driven medical imaging prediction of PD-L1 expression was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78–0.85), with a sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74–0.80) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71–0.76). For CD8+ TIL prediction, the pooled AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82–0.89), with a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72–0.87) and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76–0.84). Subgroup analysis indicated that integrating multimodal imaging and deep learning models improved predictive performance. Nevertheless, considerable heterogeneity was observed among studies (I² > 75%).
Conclusion
AI-driven medical imaging exhibits strong predictive capability for thoracic tumor TIME, particularly in PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TIL prediction. However, significant interstudy heterogeneity limits the generalizability of current models. Future studies should prioritize multicenter, large-scale research, standardization of imaging feature extraction, and integration of biological mechanisms to improve the clinical applicability of AI models.}

abstract = {Objectives
The increasing digitisation of healthcare data and the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) pave the way for innovative strategies for infectious disease management. This study aimed to systematically retrieve and summarize current evidence on the use and performance of AI-based models for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) detection (i.e., identifying infections already present in available data) and prediction (i.e., estimating future risk based on earlier patient information).
Methods
PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for experimental and observational studies published between 1 July 2018 and 12 February 2024. Primary outcomes included technical performance metrics for HAI detection and prediction (e.g. recall, precision, AUROC). Any reported clinical, organisational or economic impacts were evaluated as secondary outcomes.
Results
Of 4489 records initially identified, 121 studies were included. Twenty-five studies (20.6 %) focused on HAI detection, with more than half achieving an AUROC above 0.90. In contrast, studies on HAI prediction (n = 93, 76.9 %) reported more heterogeneous performance. Among studies comparing AI with traditional methods (n = 32), AI models outperformed conventional approaches in 81.3 % of cases (n = 26).
Conclusions
A growing body of evidence suggests that AI models are equal to or superior to traditional methods for HAI detection and prediction, but challenges remain in evaluating performance, with many studies lacking comparators, few prospective evaluations, and limited assessment of organisational impact.}

abstract = {Background
Deep learning applications in medical imaging have advanced significantly, supporting the diagnosis of spinal disorders such as disc herniation and spondylolisthesis. This study aimed to review deep learning algorithms used in diagnostic imaging for these conditions.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in the Open Science Framework. Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Lilacs, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. Studies published in the last ten years in English, Portuguese, or Spanish applying deep learning to lumbar spine imaging were included. Exclusions comprised reviews, expert opinions, and studies not focusing on lumbar imaging. Of 258 identified records, 71 duplicates were removed, leaving 187 for screening. After full-text assessment, 18 met eligibility criteria.
Results
Nine studies investigated disc herniation, primarily using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while the remaining nine focused on spondylolisthesis based on X-ray imaging. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly ResNet-based architectures, were the most frequently used models, demonstrating high accuracy and sensitivity in classification tasks. MRI was predominant for disc herniation, while X-ray was preferred for spondylolisthesis. However, limitations included small dataset sizes, lack of external validation, and challenges in generalizing findings across populations.
Conclusion
While deep learning holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, further research is needed to standardize evaluation methods, expand dataset diversity, and improve model robustness for real-world clinical applications.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into medical imaging practice, prompting calls to enhance AI education in undergraduate radiography programs. Combining evidence from literature, practitioner insights, and industry perspectives, this paper provides recommendations for medical imaging undergraduate education, including curriculum revision and re-alignment.
Key findings
A proposed modular framework is outlined to assist course providers in integrating AI into university programs. An example course design includes modules on data science fundamentals, machine learning, AI ethics and patient safety, governance and regulation, AI tool evaluation, and clinical applications. A proposal to embed these longitudinally in the curriculum combined with hands-on experience and work-integrated learning will help develop the necessary knowledge of AI and its real-world impacts. Authentic assessment examples reinforce learning, such as critically appraising published research and reflecting on current technologies. Maintenance of an up-to-date curriculum will require a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach involving educators, clinicians, and industry professionals.
Conclusion
Integrating AI education into undergraduate medical imaging programs equips future radiographers in an evolving technological landscape. A strategic approach to embedding AI modules throughout degree programs assures students a comprehensive understanding of AI principles, skills in utilising AI tools effectively, and the ability to critically evaluate their implications.
Implications for practice
The practical implementation of undergraduate AI education will prepare radiographers to incorporate these technologies while assuring patient care.}

abstract = {Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of illness and death, especially where test results arrive late. The need is simple and urgent: to reach the right diagnosis early, at the point of care, so treatment can start on time and transmission is slowed. Traditional tools, such as culture, expert-read imaging, and lab-intensive molecular tests, are accurate but slow, costly, or difficult to scale in low-resource settings. This is the right moment to improve. Health records are digitised, medical images and routine labs are abundant, sensors are cheaper, and reliable computing now fits in pockets and clinics. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) can turn this data into timely answers. Computer vision reads chest X-rays and microscope slides; models using routine labs and vital signs flag sepsis risk; language models summarize clinical notes; and genomics classifiers help identify pathogens and resistance patterns. When properly evaluated and monitored, these systems deliver faster results, more consistent readings, and earlier warnings, reducing the need for unnecessary antibiotics and prioritising care for the sickest patients. Patients benefit from quicker, targeted therapy; clinicians receive clear decision support; laboratories increase throughput; and public health teams detect outbreaks sooner. To ensure safety and fairness, solutions should be tested across diverse sites, respect privacy, minimise bias, and integrate smoothly into everyday workflows. With these guardrails, AI/ML can facilitate faster, more equitable, and truly scalable infectious disease diagnosis.}

abstract = {Images and other types of unstructural data in the medical domain are rapidly becoming data-intensive. Actionable insights from these complex data present new opportunities but also pose new challenges for classification or segmentation of unstructural data sources. Over the years, medical problems have been solved by combining traditional statistical methods with image processing methods. Both the increase in the size of the data and the increase in the resolution are among the factors that shape the ongoing improvements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly concerning deep learning (DL) techniques for evaluation of these medical data to identify, classify, and quantify patterns for clinical needs. At this point, it is important to understand how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are an important milestone in interpreting big data, transform into Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and to predict where the change will go. We aimed to explain the needs of these stages in medical image processing through the studies in the literature. At the same time, information is provided about the studies that lead to paradigm shift and try to solve the image related medical problems by using DCNNs. With the increase in the knowledge of medical doctors on this subject, it will be possible to look at the solution of new problems in computer science from different perspectives.}

Limited by hardware limitations, acquisition time, low radiation dose, and other factors, the spatial resolution of some medical images is not sufficient. To address this problem, many different SR methods have been proposed. Especially in recent years, medical image SR networks based on deep learning have been vigorously developed. This survey provides a modular and detailed introduction to the key components of medical image SR technology based on deep learning. In this paper, we first introduce the background concepts of deep learning and medical image SR task. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive analysis of the key components from the perspectives of effective architecture, upsampling module, learning strategy, and image quality assessment of medical image SR networks. Furthermore, we focus on the urgent problems that need to be addressed in the medical image SR task based on deep learning. And finally we summarize the trends and challenges of future development.}

Despite being rare in incidence and prevalence, STSs are usually correlated with unfavorable prognosis and high mortality rate. Early and accurate diagnosis of STSs are critical in clinical management of STSs. Deep learning (DL) refers to a subtype of artificial intelligence that has been adopted to assist healthcare professionals to optimize personalized treatment for a given situation, particularly in image analysis. Recently, emerging studies have demonstrated that application of DL based on medical images could substantially improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinicians to the identification, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction of STSs, and thereby facilitating the clinical decision-making. Herein, we aimed to extensively summarize the recent applications of DL-based artificial intelligence in STSs from the aspects of data acquisition, algorithm, and model establishment. Besides, the reinforcement of the model by transfer learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) for data augmentation has also been elaborated. It is worth noting that high-quality data with accurate annotations, as well as optimized algorithmic performance are pivotal in the clinical application of DL in STSs.}
